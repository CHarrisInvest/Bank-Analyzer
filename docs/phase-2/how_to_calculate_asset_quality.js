    question: 'How do I calculate the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio?',
    cluster: 'capital-and-risk',
    clusterName: 'Capital Strength and Asset Quality',
    intentType: 'procedural',
    shortAnswer: 'The NPL ratio is calculated by dividing non-performing loans (loans 90+ days past due or on non-accrual) by total loans, expressing the percentage of the loan portfolio that is no longer performing as expected',
    fullAnswer: 'The formula for the NPL ratio is:\n\nNPL Ratio = Non-Performing Loans / Total Loans\n\nThe result is expressed as a percentage.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Determine non-performing loans. Non-performing loans consist of two categories: loans that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest, and loans placed on non-accrual status. Non-accrual loans are those where the bank has stopped recognizing interest income because full collection of principal and interest is no longer expected. These two categories are typically disclosed separately in the bank\'s financial statements.\n2. Find total loans on the balance sheet. Use total loans before the deduction for the allowance for credit losses (gross loans) for consistency, though some analysts use net loans (gross loans minus the allowance). The key is to be consistent across banks and time periods.\n3. Divide non-performing loans by total loans.\n\nWorked example: A bank discloses $45 million in non-accrual loans and $8 million in loans 90+ days past due and still accruing. Total loans are $5.2 billion. Non-performing loans = $45M + $8M = $53 million. NPL ratio = $53M / $5.2B = 1.02%.\n\nWhat qualifies as non-performing: The standard definition includes loans past due 90 days or more (regardless of accrual status) and loans on non-accrual. However, some banks and analysts use a stricter definition that includes only non-accrual loans, excluding the 90+ days past due and still accruing category. When comparing NPL ratios across banks, verify which definition each bank uses in its disclosures.\n\nLoans past due 30 to 89 days are not included in the non-performing category, but they are an important early warning indicator. Banks disclose these "early-stage delinquencies" in their aging schedules, and a rising trend in 30-to-89-day delinquencies often precedes increases in the NPL ratio.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs): Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 (effective for most banks in 2023), loans that were restructured as TDRs were often classified as non-performing even if the borrower was current under the modified terms. Under the updated standard, the TDR designation was eliminated, and these loans are evaluated under the general credit loss framework. This change may have modestly reduced reported NPL levels at some banks.\n\nWhere to find the inputs: Non-performing loan data is disclosed in the bank\'s 10-K and 10-Q in the credit quality section, typically in tables showing loans by delinquency status and accrual status. Many banks also disclose non-performing loan totals in their quarterly earnings releases and investor presentations. Call report data (available through the FFIEC) provides standardized non-performing loan figures for all FDIC-insured institutions.\n\nCommon calculation mistakes: Including OREO or other foreclosed assets in the numerator (that would be the NPA ratio, not the NPL ratio). Using net loans (after the allowance deduction) inconsistently across banks. Comparing NPL ratios across banks that define non-performing loans differently without adjusting.',

    question: 'How do I calculate the non-performing assets (NPA) ratio?',
    cluster: 'capital-and-risk',
    clusterName: 'Capital Strength and Asset Quality',
    intentType: 'procedural',
    shortAnswer: 'The NPA ratio is calculated by dividing total non-performing assets (non-performing loans plus OREO and other foreclosed assets) by total assets, measuring the full scope of problem assets relative to the bank\'s balance sheet',
    fullAnswer: 'The formula for the NPA ratio is:\n\nNPA Ratio = Non-Performing Assets / Total Assets\n\nWhere:\nNon-Performing Assets = Non-Performing Loans + Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) + Other Foreclosed Assets\n\nThe result is expressed as a percentage.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Calculate non-performing loans: loans on non-accrual plus loans 90+ days past due and still accruing (same as the NPL ratio numerator).\n2. Add other real estate owned (OREO). OREO consists of real property that the bank has acquired through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or similar proceedings. It appears on the balance sheet, typically under "other assets" or as a separate line item.\n3. Add other foreclosed assets if applicable. Some banks hold non-real-estate foreclosed assets (equipment, vehicles) that are disclosed separately.\n4. The sum is total non-performing assets.\n5. Find total assets on the balance sheet.\n6. Divide non-performing assets by total assets.\n\nWorked example: A bank has $53 million in non-performing loans, $12 million in OREO, and $2 million in other foreclosed assets. Total assets are $6.8 billion. Non-performing assets = $53M + $12M + $2M = $67 million. NPA ratio = $67M / $6.8B = 0.99%.\n\nNPA ratio vs NPL ratio: The NPL ratio uses total loans as the denominator and includes only non-performing loans. The NPA ratio uses total assets as the denominator and includes OREO and other foreclosed assets in addition to non-performing loans. The NPA ratio provides a broader view of asset quality problems because it captures situations where credit problems have progressed beyond delinquent loans to actual asset seizure. The NPA ratio will typically be lower in absolute percentage terms than the NPL ratio for the same bank because total assets is a larger denominator than total loans, but it captures a wider scope of problems.\n\nRelationship to the Texas Ratio: The NPA ratio numerator (non-performing assets) is the same as the Texas Ratio numerator. The Texas Ratio divides NPAs by (tangible common equity + loan loss reserves) rather than total assets, providing a measure of whether the bank\'s capital and reserves can absorb its problem assets.\n\nOREO accounting: OREO is carried on the balance sheet at the lower of cost (the outstanding loan balance at foreclosure) or fair value minus estimated selling costs. Banks must periodically reassess OREO values and record write-downs if fair value has declined. OREO also generates ongoing costs (property taxes, insurance, maintenance) that flow through non-interest expense, reducing profitability.\n\nWhere to find the inputs: Non-performing loan data is in the credit quality disclosures in 10-K and 10-Q filings. OREO is on the balance sheet or in the notes. Many banks provide a complete non-performing asset summary in their earnings releases. Call report data from the FFIEC provides standardized NPA figures.\n\nCommon calculation mistakes: Using total loans instead of total assets in the denominator (that gives the NPL ratio, not the NPA ratio). Omitting OREO or other foreclosed assets from the numerator. Double-counting items that appear in both the NPL and OREO categories (a foreclosed property is OREO, not an NPL; the loan was removed from the loan portfolio when the property was seized).',

    question: 'How do I calculate the net charge-off ratio?',
    cluster: 'capital-and-risk',
    clusterName: 'Capital Strength and Asset Quality',
    intentType: 'procedural',
    shortAnswer: 'The net charge-off ratio is calculated by dividing net charge-offs (gross charge-offs minus recoveries) by average total loans, then annualizing if using quarterly data, to express actual realized loan losses as a percentage of the loan portfolio',
    fullAnswer: 'The formula for the net charge-off ratio is:\n\nNet Charge-Off Ratio = Net Charge-Offs / Average Total Loans\n\nWhere:\nNet Charge-Offs = Gross Charge-Offs - Recoveries\n\nThe result is expressed as an annualized percentage.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Find gross charge-offs for the period. These are loans the bank has formally written off as uncollectible and removed from the loan portfolio. Charge-off data appears in the allowance for credit losses rollforward table in 10-K and 10-Q filings.\n2. Find recoveries for the period. Recoveries are amounts collected on loans that were previously charged off. These also appear in the allowance rollforward.\n3. Subtract recoveries from gross charge-offs to get net charge-offs.\n4. Calculate average total loans. Use the average of beginning-of-period and end-of-period loan balances. For more precise calculations, use the average of five quarter-end balances (if computing an annual ratio) or the average of the current and prior quarter-end balances (if computing a quarterly figure).\n5. Divide net charge-offs by average total loans.\n6. If using quarterly data, annualize by multiplying by 4 (or more precisely, by the number of quarters in a year divided by the number of quarters in the measurement period).\n\nWorked example: A bank reports gross charge-offs of $18 million and recoveries of $3 million for the quarter. Average loans for the quarter are $5.0 billion. Net charge-offs = $18M - $3M = $15 million. Quarterly ratio = $15M / $5.0B = 0.30%. Annualized = 0.30% x 4 = 1.20%.\n\nAnnualizing quarterly data: This step is critical when comparing quarterly charge-off data to annual benchmarks or across banks that report in different periods. Quarterly net charge-offs must be multiplied by 4 to produce an annualized rate. For trailing twelve months (TTM) calculations, sum the four most recent quarters of net charge-offs and divide by the average loans over the same period.\n\nGross vs net: Gross charge-offs represent the total loans written off. Net charge-offs are reduced by recoveries on previously charged-off loans. The gross charge-off figure is useful for understanding the total magnitude of write-offs, while the net figure provides the true economic loss after recovery efforts. Recoveries can be significant for collateralized loan categories (commercial real estate, auto loans) and minimal for unsecured categories (credit cards).\n\nRelationship to provision expense: Net charge-offs flow through the allowance for credit losses. When a loan is charged off, the allowance decreases. Provision expense replenishes the allowance. If net charge-offs exceed provision expense over time, the allowance is being depleted. If provisions exceed charge-offs, the allowance is being built. Comparing the two figures reveals whether the bank is provisioning ahead of or behind its actual loss experience.\n\nRelationship to NPL ratio: The NPL ratio measures the stock of problem loans at a point in time. The net charge-off ratio measures the flow of actual losses over a period. A bank can have a stable NPL ratio with rising charge-offs if new NPLs are being added at the same rate old ones are being charged off. Tracking both metrics together provides a more complete picture of credit quality dynamics.\n\nWhere to find the inputs: The allowance for credit losses rollforward table in 10-K and 10-Q filings shows beginning balance, provision expense, gross charge-offs, recoveries, and ending balance. Many banks also disclose net charge-off data by loan category in their earnings releases and supplemental financial tables. Call report data from the FFIEC provides standardized charge-off figures.',

    question: 'How do I calculate the loan loss reserve ratio?',
    cluster: 'capital-and-risk',
    clusterName: 'Capital Strength and Asset Quality',
    intentType: 'procedural',
    shortAnswer: 'The loan loss reserve ratio is calculated by dividing the allowance for credit losses by total loans, measuring what percentage of the loan portfolio the bank has reserved against for expected future losses',
    fullAnswer: 'The formula for the loan loss reserve ratio is:\n\nLoan Loss Reserve Ratio = Allowance for Credit Losses / Total Loans\n\nThe result is expressed as a percentage.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Find the allowance for credit losses (ACL) on the balance sheet. This appears as a contra-asset that reduces the gross loan figure to arrive at net loans. It may be labeled "allowance for loan and lease losses" (ALLL) in older filings, though the terminology shifted to ACL with the adoption of CECL.\n2. Find total loans on the balance sheet. Use gross loans (before the allowance deduction) in the denominator. Total loans may be labeled "loans and leases, net of unearned income" or similar.\n3. Divide the allowance by total loans.\n\nWorked example: A bank has an allowance for credit losses of $72 million and total gross loans of $5.2 billion. Loan loss reserve ratio = $72M / $5.2B = 1.38%.\n\nHow the allowance is built and used: The allowance is increased through provision expense (a charge on the income statement) and decreased when loans are charged off. Recoveries on previously charged-off loans add back to the allowance. The allowance rollforward in the financial statements shows each of these components: Beginning allowance + Provision - Charge-offs + Recoveries = Ending allowance.\n\nCECL impact on reserve levels: Under the CECL standard (ASC 326), banks estimate lifetime expected credit losses at origination, which generally produces higher reserve levels than the prior incurred-loss model, particularly for longer-duration loan portfolios. When comparing reserve ratios across time periods, the shift to CECL (effective 2020 for large banks, 2023 for smaller banks) represents a structural increase that does not necessarily indicate worsening credit quality.\n\nReserve ratio by loan category: Banks disclose the allowance allocation by loan type (commercial real estate, C&I, residential mortgage, consumer, etc.) in the notes to financial statements. This breakdown reveals which loan categories management views as carrying the most risk. For example, a bank might reserve 0.50% against its residential mortgage portfolio but 2.50% against its construction loan portfolio, reflecting the different risk profiles.\n\nRelationship to reserve coverage: The loan loss reserve ratio measures reserves relative to the total loan portfolio. The reserve coverage ratio measures reserves relative to non-performing loans specifically. A bank can have a moderate reserve ratio (1.3%) but strong reserve coverage (150%) if its NPLs are low relative to its total portfolio. Both perspectives are useful for different aspects of credit analysis.\n\nRelationship to provision expense: If the reserve ratio is stable over time while the loan portfolio is growing, provision expense must be keeping pace to maintain the ratio. A declining reserve ratio during a period of loan growth may indicate the bank is not provisioning adequately, or it may reflect improving credit quality that justifies lower reserves.\n\nWhere to find the inputs: The allowance for credit losses is on the balance sheet and in the notes to financial statements. The allowance rollforward table in the 10-K and 10-Q provides the full detail of provisions, charge-offs, and recoveries. Total gross loans are on the balance sheet.',

    clusterName: 'Capital Strength and Asset Quality',
    intentType: 'procedural',
    shortAnswer: 'The reserve coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the allowance for credit losses by non-performing loans, measuring how many dollars of reserves the bank holds for each dollar of known problem loans',
    fullAnswer: 'The formula for the reserve coverage ratio is:\n\nReserve Coverage Ratio = Allowance for Credit Losses / Non-Performing Loans\n\nThe result is expressed as a percentage. A ratio of 150% means the bank has $1.50 in reserves for every $1.00 of non-performing loans.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Find the allowance for credit losses (ACL) on the balance sheet.\n2. Calculate non-performing loans: non-accrual loans plus loans 90+ days past due and still accruing. These figures are in the credit quality disclosures in 10-K and 10-Q filings.\n3. Divide the allowance by non-performing loans.\n\nWorked example: A bank has an allowance for credit losses of $72 million and non-performing loans of $53 million. Reserve coverage ratio = $72M / $53M = 135.8%. The bank has reserved $1.36 for each dollar of non-performing loans.\n\nWhy 100% coverage matters: If all non-performing loans resulted in total loss (zero recovery), reserve coverage of 100% means the bank could absorb those losses entirely from its existing allowance without charging earnings or equity. In practice, most non-performing loans recover some value through collateral liquidation, restructuring, or eventual repayment, so coverage below 100% does not automatically mean the bank is under-provisioned. However, coverage significantly below 100% should prompt investigation into the collateral backing the non-performing loans and the bank\'s loss severity assumptions.\n\nTypical ranges: For U.S. banks during normal economic conditions, reserve coverage ratios typically range from 80% to 200%. Banks with well-collateralized non-performing loans (such as commercial real estate with strong collateral values) may appropriately maintain coverage around 80% to 100%. Banks with significant unsecured non-performing exposures (credit cards, personal loans) should generally maintain higher coverage because recovery rates are lower. Coverage above 200% may indicate either very conservative provisioning or a very small NPL base.\n\nCECL and reserve coverage: Under CECL, the allowance covers estimated lifetime losses on the entire loan portfolio, not just non-performing loans. This means the allowance includes reserves for loans that are currently performing but are expected to experience some level of loss over their remaining life. As a result, the reserve coverage ratio under CECL tends to be higher than it was under the prior incurred-loss model, because the allowance now covers a broader scope of expected losses.\n\nEdge case when NPLs are very low: When non-performing loans approach zero, the reserve coverage ratio can become very large (500%, 1,000%, or higher) and loses practical meaning. In these situations, the loan loss reserve ratio (allowance divided by total loans) is a more informative measure of provisioning adequacy.\n\nWhere to find the inputs: The allowance for credit losses is on the balance sheet. Non-performing loan figures are in the credit quality disclosures. Many banks report the reserve coverage ratio directly in their earnings releases and investor presentations.',

    clusterName: 'Capital Strength and Asset Quality',
    intentType: 'procedural',
    shortAnswer: 'The Texas Ratio is calculated by dividing non-performing assets by the sum of tangible common equity and the allowance for credit losses, measuring whether a bank has sufficient capital and reserves to absorb its problem assets',
    fullAnswer: 'The formula for the Texas Ratio is:\n\nTexas Ratio = Non-Performing Assets / (Tangible Common Equity + Allowance for Credit Losses)\n\nThe result is expressed as a percentage.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Calculate non-performing assets: non-performing loans (non-accrual + 90+ days past due) plus OREO plus other foreclosed assets.\n2. Calculate tangible common equity: total shareholders\' equity minus goodwill, minus other intangible assets, minus preferred stock.\n3. Find the allowance for credit losses on the balance sheet.\n4. Add tangible common equity and the allowance for credit losses. This sum represents the total loss-absorbing capacity available to cover problem assets.\n5. Divide non-performing assets by the sum from step 4.\n\nWorked example: A bank has $67 million in non-performing assets (from the NPA calculation). Tangible common equity is $520 million (total equity of $600M minus $70M goodwill minus $10M intangibles, no preferred stock). The allowance for credit losses is $55 million. Texas Ratio = $67M / ($520M + $55M) = $67M / $575M = 11.7%.\n\nWhy 100% is the critical threshold: A Texas Ratio above 100% means the bank\'s non-performing assets exceed its combined tangible equity and reserves. At this level, if the bank were forced to write off all its problem assets immediately, it would not have enough capital and reserves to absorb the losses without becoming insolvent. Historically, Texas Ratios above 100% have been associated with significantly elevated failure risk, particularly when the ratio is rising and problem assets are not being resolved.\n\nUsing tangible common equity vs total equity: The standard Texas Ratio formula uses tangible common equity because goodwill and intangible assets cannot absorb losses. Some simplified versions use total equity in the denominator, which produces a lower (more favorable) ratio but is less conservative. For the most meaningful analysis, use the tangible version.\n\nAlternative denominator formulations: Some analysts use loan loss reserves (a synonym for the allowance for credit losses) in the denominator. Others use total capital and reserves. The most common formulation uses tangible common equity plus the allowance. Be aware of which version a source is using when comparing Texas Ratio figures across different analysts or data providers.\n\nThe Texas Ratio as a screening tool: The ratio was designed as a failure prediction tool and is most useful for quickly identifying banks under credit stress. Screening for banks with Texas Ratios above 50% identifies institutions where credit problems are consuming a meaningful share of the loss-absorbing cushion. Screening for ratios below 20% identifies banks where asset quality problems are well within manageable bounds.\n\nTrend matters more than a single reading: A Texas Ratio that has risen from 15% to 40% over four quarters is more concerning than a stable ratio at 45%. The trajectory indicates whether credit problems are growing or stabilizing.\n\nWhere to find the inputs: Non-performing asset data is in the credit quality disclosures. Total equity, goodwill, and intangibles are on the balance sheet. The allowance for credit losses is on the balance sheet. All inputs are available from 10-K, 10-Q, earnings releases, and FFIEC call report data.',

    clusterName: 'Capital Strength and Asset Quality',
    intentType: 'procedural',
    shortAnswer: 'The provision to average loans ratio is calculated by dividing the provision for credit losses by average total loans for the period, then annualizing if using quarterly data, to measure the current-period intensity of loss provisioning relative to the loan portfolio',
    fullAnswer: 'The formula for the provision to average loans ratio is:\n\nProvision to Average Loans = Provision for Credit Losses / Average Total Loans\n\nThe result is expressed as an annualized percentage.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Find the provision for credit losses on the income statement. This is the expense the bank records to build or maintain the allowance for credit losses. It may be labeled "provision for credit losses," "provision for loan and lease losses," or similar.\n2. Calculate average total loans for the period. Use the average of beginning-of-period and end-of-period gross loan balances.\n3. Divide the provision by average total loans.\n4. If using quarterly data, annualize the result by multiplying by 4.\n\nWorked example: A bank reports provision for credit losses of $14 million for the quarter. Average loans for the quarter are $5.1 billion. Quarterly ratio = $14M / $5.1B = 0.27%. Annualized = 0.27% x 4 = 1.10%.\n\nWhat the ratio measures: This ratio captures the current-period cost of credit risk as recognized by management. A higher ratio means the bank is setting aside a larger share of its loan portfolio value for expected losses, either because current credit conditions are deteriorating, because the economic outlook has worsened (under CECL), or because the bank is building reserves in anticipation of future problems.\n\nProvision vs net charge-offs: These two metrics are related but measure different things. Net charge-offs represent realized losses (loans actually written off). Provision expense represents management\'s estimate of the losses that need to be reserved for (which includes losses not yet realized). The relationship between the two reveals management\'s forward-looking assessment:\n\nIf provision > net charge-offs: The bank is building reserves. Management expects future credit losses to exceed current realized losses. This is typical during the early stages of credit deterioration or when economic forecasts worsen.\n\nIf provision < net charge-offs: The bank is releasing reserves or provisioning below the current loss run rate. This can occur during credit recovery periods when management expects future losses to decline, or it can indicate the bank is under-provisioning if the outlook is not actually improving.\n\nIf provision approximately equals net charge-offs: The bank is maintaining a stable reserve level, replacing charged-off amounts with new provisions. This suggests management views the current loss rate as representative of expected future losses.\n\nCECL effects on provision volatility: Under CECL, provision expense can be more volatile than under the prior incurred-loss model because changes in economic forecasts immediately flow through to the allowance estimate and therefore to provision expense. A significant worsening in the economic outlook can produce a large provision charge even if current loan performance has not yet deteriorated. This makes single-quarter provision figures potentially noisy; trailing twelve-month figures or multi-quarter averages provide smoother signals.\n\nNegative provisions (reserve releases): Under CECL, if economic conditions improve or credit quality strengthens beyond expectations, the bank may record a negative provision (a benefit to income rather than an expense) as it releases reserves that are no longer needed. Reserve releases boost earnings but are not sustainable over time.\n\nWhere to find the inputs: Provision for credit losses is on the income statement in 10-K and 10-Q filings and in quarterly earnings releases. Total loans are on the balance sheet. The allowance rollforward table shows how provision expense, charge-offs, and recoveries interact to produce the ending allowance balance.',
