## 1. Site Review Summary

### Current Content Footprint (Post-Phase 1)

**Total pre-rendered pages: 444**

| Category | Count | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Static pages | 9 | Hardcoded in prerender.mjs |
| FAQ pages | 73 | 1 index + 72 individual (from faqs.js) |
| Metric pages | 13 | From metrics.js METRICS array |
| Valuation pages | 7 | From valuations.js VALUATION_METHODS array |
| Bank detail pages | 342 | From banks.json (347 total, 5 skipped without tickers) |

**Interactive Tools:**
- Bank Screener (/screener) -- filter 300+ banks by 25+ metrics
- Bank Search (/search) -- find banks by name, ticker, or CIK
- Screener Guide (/screener/guide) -- usage instructions and screening strategies

**Educational Content:**
- Metrics hub (/metrics) -- index page linking to 13 individual metric pages (all expanded with Phase 1 content)
- Valuation hub (/valuation) -- index page linking to 7 valuation method pages (all expanded with Phase 1 content)
- FAQ hub (/faq) -- index page with 72 FAQ entries across 11 clusters (4 clusters populated, 7 awaiting Phase 2/3 content)
- Glossary (/glossary) -- ~96 terms across 10 categories (auto-generated from metrics/valuations + 76 manual terms)

**13 Metric Pages (all with expansion fields):**
ROE, ROAA, NIM, Efficiency Ratio, P/B, P/E, EPS, BVPS, Equity to Assets, Loans to Deposits, Deposits to Assets, Loans to Assets, Dividend Payout Ratio

**7 Valuation Method Pages (all with expansion fields):**
Graham Number, Margin of Safety, Dividend Discount Model, P/B Valuation, P/E Valuation, Peer Comparison Analysis, ROE-P/B Framework

**72 FAQ Pages (Phase 1):**
- Cluster 1: Getting Started with Bank Stocks (15 questions)
- Cluster 3: Bank Profitability Metrics (13 standard + 3 How to Calculate)
- Cluster 4: Bank Efficiency and Funding (4 How to Calculate only)
- Cluster 5: Capital Strength and Asset Quality (1 How to Calculate only)
- Cluster 6: How to Value Bank Stocks (17 standard + 4 How to Calculate)
- Cluster 7: Bank Dividends and Shareholder Returns (1 How to Calculate only)
- Cluster 10: Screening and Analysis Strategies (14 questions)

**Static Pages:**
Homepage, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service

### Content Gaps Remaining (Phase 2 & 3)

1. **Capital strength and asset quality metrics** -- CET1, Tier 1, Texas Ratio, NPL, net charge-offs, and other critical bank analysis metrics have no dedicated pages yet (23 new metric pages planned)
2. **New valuation methods** -- 5 additional valuation method pages planned (P/TBV, Excess Capital Return, Discounted Earnings, Gordon Growth, DuPont Decomposition)
3. **Unpopulated FAQ clusters** -- Clusters 2 (Financial Statements), 4 (Efficiency standard questions), 5 (Capital/Risk standard questions), 7 (Dividends standard questions), 8 (Interest Rates), 9 (Bank Types), 11 (Advanced) still need standard FAQ content
4. **"How to Calculate" pages for new metrics** -- 23 additional calculation guides needed once new metric pages are added
5. **Glossary expansion** -- Additional terms will be needed as new metric/valuation pages are added (auto-generated terms will handle most of this)


## 2. Technical Architecture & Implementation Reference

### Site Architecture Overview

BankSift is a **React 18 single-page application** built with **Vite 5**, deployed to **GitHub Pages**. There are no Markdown files or static site generators. Everything is JavaScript/JSX.

The site uses a **dual-render approach** for SEO:
1. Pre-rendered static HTML (`#seo-root`) generated by `scripts/prerender.mjs` at build time -- full content, meta tags, OG data, JSON-LD schema
2. React SPA (`#root`) hydrates on top; `document.body.classList.add('react-ready')` hides `#seo-root` via CSS

**Schema.org structured data is defined ONLY in `prerender.mjs`** to prevent duplication after hydration. Page components include comments noting this convention.

### Route Structure

| Route Pattern | Component | Page Type | Count |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | Home | Static | 1 |
| `/search` | Search | Tool (dynamic) | 1 |
| `/screener` | ScreenerPage | Tool (dynamic) | 1 |
| `/screener/guide` | ScreenerGuide | Static content | 1 |
| `/bank/:ticker` | BankDetail | Dynamic | 342 |
| `/metrics` | MetricsIndex | Static content | 1 |
| `/metrics/:slug` | MetricDetail | Content | 13 |
| `/valuation` | ValuationIndex | Static content | 1 |
| `/valuation/:slug` | ValuationDetail | Content | 7 |
| `/faq` | FaqIndex | Content index | 1 |
| `/faq/:faqSlug` | FaqDetail | Content | 72 |
| `/glossary` | Glossary | Static content | 1 |
| `/privacy` | Privacy | Legal | 1 |
| `/terms` | Terms | Legal | 1 |
| `*` | NotFound | 404 | 1 |

### URL Conventions

- Slugs are kebab-case: `what-are-bank-stocks`, `price-to-book`, `graham-number`
- No trailing slashes
- **FAQ URLs are flat**: `/faq/:faqSlug` -- no cluster/category in URL. Clusters are a data-level grouping only, used for visual section headers on the FAQ index page. There are NO cluster index pages (e.g., `/faq/getting-started` does not exist as a page).
- Bank URLs use ticker symbols: `/bank/JPM`, `/bank/BAC`
- Content pages use descriptive slugs: `/metrics/roe`, `/valuation/graham-number`

### Template + Data Pattern

The site uses reusable React components as templates with content driven by JavaScript data arrays:

| Page Type | Template Component | Data Source |
|---|---|---|
| Bank pages (/bank/:ticker) | `src/pages/BankDetail.jsx` | `public/data/banks.json` + `public/data/banks/{CIK}.json` |
| Metric pages (/metrics/:slug) | `src/pages/MetricDetail.jsx` | `METRICS` array in `src/data/content/metrics.js` |
| Valuation pages (/valuation/:slug) | `src/pages/ValuationDetail.jsx` | `VALUATION_METHODS` array in `src/data/content/valuations.js` |
| FAQ pages (/faq/:faqSlug) | `src/pages/FaqDetail.jsx` | `FAQS` array in `src/data/content/faqs.js` |
| FAQ index (/faq) | `src/pages/FaqIndex.jsx` | `FAQ_CLUSTERS` + `FAQS` in `src/data/content/faqs.js` |
| Index pages (/metrics, /valuation) | Standalone `.jsx` components | Iterate over same data arrays |
| Glossary (/glossary) | `src/pages/Glossary.jsx` | Auto-generated from METRICS + VALUATION_METHODS + `ADDITIONAL_TERMS` |
| Static pages | Standalone `.jsx` in `src/pages/` | Content inline in JSX |

### Build Pipeline

```
npm run build
  -> vite build              (bundles React SPA to dist/)
  -> generate-sitemap.mjs    (creates sitemap.xml from data + route definitions)
  -> prerender.mjs           (generates static HTML for all 444 routes)
```

Post-deploy: GitHub Actions notifies Bing/Yandex via IndexNow. Bank data updates daily from SEC EDGAR with automatic rebuild/redeploy on data changes.

### Navigation Structure

**Research:** Search (`/search`), Screener (`/screener`)
**Learn:** Screener Guide (`/screener/guide`), Metrics & Ratios (`/metrics`), Valuation (`/valuation`), FAQ (`/faq`), Glossary (`/glossary`)
**About (mobile only):** Privacy Policy (`/privacy`), Terms of Service (`/terms`)

### How to Add New Content

**To add a new page within an existing type** (e.g., a new metric or new FAQ):
-> Add an entry to the corresponding data array (e.g., `metrics.js` or `faqs.js`)
-> The existing template component, prerender block, and sitemap generator handle the rest

**To add a new page type:**
-> Create a new data array file (e.g., `src/data/content/newtype.js`)
-> Create template component(s) in `src/pages/`
-> Add route(s) in `src/App.jsx`
-> Add pre-rendering block in `scripts/prerender.mjs`
-> Add route enumeration in `scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs`
-> Update internal linking in relevant existing components/data

### Key Implementation Conventions

1. FAQ URLs are flat (`/faq/:faqSlug`). New FAQs only need a unique slug. Never put the cluster in the URL.
2. Any new page type must be added to BOTH `src/App.jsx` (React router) AND `scripts/prerender.mjs` AND `scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs`.
3. Schema/JSON-LD goes in `prerender.mjs` only -- never in React components.
4. New metrics/valuations auto-appear in glossary. Use `METRIC_CATEGORY_OVERRIDES` for wrong categories. Manual terms go in `ADDITIONAL_TERMS` in `Glossary.jsx`.
5. Update `METRIC_TO_VALUATIONS` and `VALUATION_TO_METRICS` maps in `prerender.mjs` when adding new metrics or valuations.
6. Always run full `npm run build` after changes to verify page counts.

## 3. Strategic Framework

### 3.1 Content Differentiation Strategy

BankSift's content advantage is **bank specificity**. Every page should demonstrate expertise that a general finance site cannot match. This means:

**Always frame through a banking lens.** When explaining ROE, don't explain what ROE means generically â€” explain why ROE behaves differently for banks (leverage dynamics, regulatory capital constraints, provision volatility). When discussing P/E, explain why P/E is used cautiously for banks compared to other sectors and when it breaks down.

**Connect metrics to each other in bank-specific ways.** Show how NIM flows through to ROE via the DuPont decomposition. Explain why Efficiency Ratio and ROE often move together for banks but can diverge. Describe why P/B and ROE are linked through the justified P/B framework. These connections are the kind of insight that only a bank-focused site provides naturally.

**Address bank-specific pitfalls and misapplications.** Explain why EV/EBITDA doesn't work for banks. Discuss why comparing a community bank's efficiency ratio to a money center bank is misleading. Note that a P/B below 1.0 doesn't automatically mean undervalued if the bank has asset quality problems.

**Provide practical, actionable guidance.** Don't just define a formula â€” explain where to find each input in actual SEC filings, what adjustments to consider, and what the result means for an investment decision.

### 3.2 Evergreen Content Philosophy

**All FAQ pages should contain content that remains accurate and useful without requiring regular updates.** This means:

**Do include:**
- Foundational concepts and definitions (what is ROE, how do banks make money)
- Formulas, calculation methods, and alternative approaches
- Typical/historical ranges with clear sourcing and time period references (e.g., "US banks have historically averaged ROE between 8-12% based on FDIC data")
- Explanations of *how* metrics, regulations, and market dynamics work in principle
- References to historical events as illustrative examples when framed as lessons (e.g., "periods of rapidly rising rates have historically compressed bank margins initially before expanding them" rather than "in 2022, the Fed raised rates and banks saw...")

**Do not include:**
- Current metric averages that would go stale (unless dynamically sourced â€” see Section 3.8)
- Active regulatory proposals or pending legislation
- Current Fed policy stance or rate expectations
- Specific recent events as primary content (COVID impacts, SVB failure, 2023 banking crisis)
- Any claim that depends on a specific date remaining current

**Content moved to future blog/insights section (not part of this FAQ implementation):**
- History and evolution of Basel III and stress testing
- Detailed Dodd-Frank Act analysis
- The Volcker Rule's impact
- SIFI designation and too-big-to-fail analysis
- 2008 financial crisis detailed narrative
- COVID-19 impact on bank dividends
- 2023 banking crisis (SVB, Signature, First Republic) narrative
- Current regulatory environment analysis

### 3.3 Call-to-Action Guidelines

**Only reference the screener when the FAQ topic directly involves a metric available as a screener column or filter.**

**Current screener metrics (eligible for screener CTAs):**
ROE, ROAA, NIM, Efficiency Ratio, P/B, P/E, EPS, BVPS, Equity to Assets, Loans to Deposits, Deposits to Assets, Loans to Assets, Dividend Payout Ratio, Graham Number, Margin of Safety, Market Cap, Total Assets, Share Price, Shares Outstanding, Total Equity, Net Income, Total Deposits, Total Loans, Interest Income, Interest Expense, Non-Interest Income, Non-Interest Expense, Revenue

**For topics that don't map to a screener filter**, the CTA should direct users to:
- Learn more about a related metric or valuation method on BankSift
- Explore related FAQ pages on adjacent topics
- Use Bank Search to look up a specific bank's profile
- Visit the glossary for related term definitions

**For new metric pages that are educational only** (capital ratios, Texas Ratio, NPL, etc.): The page should NOT suggest using the metric in the screener. The CTA should direct users to related educational content, the glossary, or metrics that ARE available in the screener.

**Implementation note for Claude Code:** Each FAQ entry in the data array should include a `cta` field specifying the appropriate call-to-action type and target. See Section 13.3 for data structure details.

### 3.4 Data Sourcing Guidelines

**All factual claims, statistics, and examples must come from authoritative, verifiable external sources â€” not from BankSift's own screener or calculated data.**

**Source requirements by content type:**

| Content Type | Required Source | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Industry statistics (avg ROE, avg NIM, bank count) | FDIC, Federal Reserve, FFIEC | FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile |
| Typical metric ranges | FDIC/Fed aggregate data, academic literature | "US banks have historically averaged NIM of 3.0-3.5% (FDIC)" |
| Regulatory thresholds | Regulatory agency publications | "Minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5% (Federal Reserve)" |
| Individual bank examples | SEC EDGAR filings, FDIC call reports, bank IR materials | Do not use BankSift calculated fields |
| Historical events | FDIC reports, Federal Reserve publications, NBER | FDIC failure reports, Fed crisis analyses |
| Formulas and definitions | FFIEC instructions, regulatory definitions, standard accounting references | FFIEC Uniform Bank Performance Report instructions |

**Recommended authoritative sources:**
- FDIC (fdic.gov) â€” bank statistics, failure data, deposit insurance, industry aggregates
- Federal Reserve (federalreserve.gov) â€” monetary policy, capital requirements, stress tests, aggregate data
- FFIEC (ffiec.gov) â€” call report data, Uniform Bank Performance Reports
- SEC EDGAR (sec.gov/edgar) â€” individual bank filings (10-K, 10-Q)
- OCC (occ.gov) â€” national bank regulation
- Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED (fred.stlouisfed.org) â€” economic data series
- NBER (nber.org) â€” business cycle dating, recession research

**Critical distinction:** BankSift should be positioned as a tool for users to explore and analyze current data themselves, while the editorial/educational content is grounded in independently verifiable sources. This builds trust and avoids the appearance of self-referencing.

**Implementation note for Claude Code:** Where content references specific statistics, include the source in the data array field so it can be rendered as a citation or footnote on the page.

### 3.5 Search Intent Segmentation

Each FAQ page targets a specific search intent type. This affects page structure, content depth, and formatting.

**Intent types and their page structure:**

| Intent Type | Description | Page Structure | Example Questions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Definitional** | "What is X?" | Lead with clear definition, then bank-specific context, then connections to related concepts | "What is net interest margin?" |
| **Evaluative** | "What is a good X?" / "How do I interpret X?" | Lead with the answer/range, then explain why, then caveats and context | "What is a good ROE for a bank?" |
| **Comparative** | "X vs Y" / "What is the difference between X and Y?" | Lead with the key distinction, then when to use each, then practical implications | "ROE vs ROAA: when should I use each?" |
| **Procedural** | "How do I calculate/do X?" | Lead with the formula/steps, then alternatives, then bank-specific nuances and where to find inputs | "How do I calculate tangible book value?" |
| **Strategic** | "How do I use X to do Y?" | Lead with the approach, then walk through the logic, then connect to BankSift tools where appropriate | "How do I screen for undervalued bank stocks?" |
| **Conceptual** | "Why does X happen/matter?" | Lead with the explanation, then supporting detail, then implications for investors | "Why is P/B the primary valuation metric for banks?" |

**Implementation note for Claude Code:** Each FAQ entry in the data array should include an `intentType` field (one of: `definitional`, `evaluative`, `comparative`, `procedural`, `strategic`, `conceptual`). This can be used by the template component to adjust page structure or by the prerender script for structured data markup.

### 3.6 Metric & Valuation Page Expansion Guidelines

**Every existing and new metric page should be expanded beyond the current template to include the following sections where applicable:**

| Section | Description | Applies To |
|---|---|---|
| Overview | What the metric is and why it matters (existing) | All |
| Formula | Primary calculation formula (existing) | All |
| Bank-Specific Context | Why this metric behaves differently for banks vs other industries | All |
| Interpretation | How to read the metric, what high/low values signal (existing, expanded) | All |
| Typical Range | Historical range for US banks with authoritative source citation | All where data available |
| What Drives This Metric | Specific bank-level and macro-level factors that cause the metric to move up or down | All |
| Common Pitfalls | Misreadings, misapplications, and traps specific to using this metric for bank analysis | All where applicable |
| Metric Connections | How this metric relates to and interacts with other bank metrics (e.g., DuPont decomposition, ROE-P/B relationship) | All where connections exist |
| Across Bank Types | How the metric typically differs across community, regional, and money center banks | All where meaningful differences exist |
| Related Metrics | Links to related metric pages (existing, expanded) | All |
| Related Valuation Methods | Links to valuation pages that use this metric (existing) | All where applicable |
| FAQ Teasers | 2-3 most relevant FAQ questions with brief teaser answers linking to full FAQ pages | All |
| Data Source | Where the data comes from and how it's calculated on BankSift (existing) | Metrics available in screener |

**For new metric pages that are educational only** (not in screener): Include all sections above except "Data Source" should be replaced with "Where to Find This Data" explaining where investors can look up this metric for individual banks (e.g., FDIC call reports, bank 10-K filings, Federal Reserve data).

**The same expansion approach applies to valuation method pages**, with section names adjusted as appropriate (e.g., "Method Steps" instead of "Formula," "When to Use This Method" instead of "Typical Range," "Method Limitations" instead of "Common Pitfalls").

**Implementation note for Claude Code:** The existing data array fields in `metrics.js` and `valuations.js` will need to be extended with new fields for the additional sections. See Section 6.2 for the updated data structures and Section 13 for conventions. The template components (`MetricDetail.jsx`, `ValuationDetail.jsx`) will need to render these new sections conditionally (only when the field is present and non-empty, so existing pages can be expanded incrementally).

### 3.7 Cannibalization Management

**Problem:** The homepage currently has 6 FAQ questions, and the valuation page has 3 FAQ questions. Once dedicated FAQ pages exist for these topics, having full answers on both the hub page and the FAQ page creates duplicate content that competes with itself in search results.

**Solution: Convert existing FAQs on hub pages to teasers.**

For every FAQ currently appearing on the homepage, metrics hub, valuation hub, or individual metric/valuation pages:
1. Shorten the answer to 1-2 sentences (a teaser)
2. Add a "Read more â†’" link to the full dedicated FAQ page
3. Retain the question text as-is (it serves as an anchor for the teaser)

**Additionally:** Review which FAQs appear on each page and ensure only the most relevant and strongest questions remain. The goal is 2-3 FAQ teasers per page, not an exhaustive list.

**Add a visible link to the FAQ section** from:
- Homepage (in the "What You Can Do" section or a new "Learn More" section)
- Metrics hub page (after the metric listings)
- Valuation hub page (after the method listings)
- Each individual metric page (in the FAQ Teasers section described above)
- Each individual valuation page (in the FAQ Teasers section described above)

**Implementation note for Claude Code:** The existing FAQ content in the homepage JSX and the valuation page data/JSX should be edited to shortened teasers with links. The FAQ teaser data for metric and valuation pages should be part of the expanded data array fields (see Section 6). Add a `/faq` link to the site navigation alongside the existing Metrics, Valuation, and Glossary links.

### 3.8 Programmatic/Semi-Dynamic Content

**Limited use, only where data can be updated automatically from trusted external sources without manual maintenance.**

**Eligible for dynamic treatment:**
- Count of banks tracked on BankSift (already derived from the data pipeline)
- Aggregate statistics that can be computed from the existing SEC EDGAR data pipeline at build time (e.g., median P/B across all tracked banks) â€” but these should be clearly labeled as "BankSift calculated from SEC filings" and not presented as authoritative industry statistics

**Not eligible (requires manual maintenance):**
- FDIC or Federal Reserve aggregate statistics
- Regulatory thresholds
- Any data not already in the automated pipeline

**Implementation approach:** If dynamic data is used, compute it in the build pipeline (e.g., in `prerender.mjs` or a new build script that reads from `banks.json`) and inject it into the pre-rendered HTML. The React component can also compute it client-side from loaded data. Always include a "last updated" indicator and clear labeling of the data source.

**Recommendation:** Keep this minimal for now. The evergreen editorial content is the priority. Dynamic data can be layered in later once the content foundation is solid.

## 4. New Metric Pages

These metrics should be added to the `METRICS` array in `src/data/content/metrics.js` following the expanded page structure defined in Section 3.6. Each entry should include all applicable fields.

### 4.1 Capital Strength Metrics (New Category)

These are **educational pages only** â€” these metrics are not currently in the screener or data pipeline. Pages should not suggest using these metrics in the screener. The "Where to Find This Data" section should direct users to FDIC call reports, Federal Reserve FR Y-9C filings, or the bank's own 10-K/10-Q disclosures.

| # | Metric | Slug | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | CET1 Capital Ratio | `cet1-capital-ratio` | Common Equity Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. The highest-quality capital measure under Basel III. |

| 17 | Net Overhead Ratio | `net-overhead-ratio` | Yes | (Non-interest expense minus non-interest income) divided by average assets. Measures burden of non-lending operations. |

### 4.4 Additional Valuation Metrics

| # | Metric | Slug | Educational Only? | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|

**Total new metric pages: 23**
**New total metric pages: 36** (13 existing + 23 new)

### Metric Page Categorization (Updated)

For the metrics hub page (/metrics) and navigation, the updated category structure should be:

1. **Profitability Ratios** â€” ROE, ROAA, NIM, ROTCE, PPNR, Net Overhead Ratio
2. **Efficiency & Funding Ratios** â€” Efficiency Ratio, Deposits to Assets, Loans to Deposits, Cost of Funds, Cost of Deposits, Non-Interest Income to Revenue, Interest Income to Earning Assets
3. **Capital Strength Ratios** â€” Equity to Assets, TCE Ratio, CET1, Tier 1, Total Capital, Leverage Ratio, SLR, RWA Density
4. **Asset Quality Ratios** â€” NPL Ratio, NPA Ratio, Net Charge-Off Ratio, Loan Loss Reserve Ratio, Reserve Coverage Ratio, Texas Ratio, Provision to Average Loans
5. **Valuation Metrics** â€” BVPS, TBVPS, P/B, P/TBV, P/E, EPS, Dividend Payout Ratio
6. **Balance Sheet Ratios** â€” Loans to Assets (existing)

## 5. New Valuation Method Pages

These should be added to the `VALUATION_METHODS` array in `src/data/content/valuations.js` following the expanded page structure.

| # | Method | Slug | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Price to Tangible Book Value Valuation | `price-to-tangible-book-valuation` | Valuing banks using P/TBV rather than P/B, with guidance on when TBV is more appropriate (banks with significant goodwill from acquisitions). |

| 4 | Gordon Growth Model (Bank Application) | `gordon-growth-model` | Simplified DDM variant (P = D1 / (r - g)) applied specifically to bank stocks, with discussion of how to estimate sustainable growth rate for banks using ROE and retention ratio. |
| 5 | DuPont Decomposition for Banks | `dupont-decomposition` | Breaking ROE into component drivers (profit margin Ã— asset utilization Ã— equity multiplier) adapted for bank-specific financial structure. Not a valuation method per se, but a fundamental framework that informs all bank valuation. |

**Total new valuation pages: 5**
**New total valuation pages: 12** (7 existing + 5 new)

## 6. Existing Metric & Valuation Page Expansion

### 6.1 Content Additions for Each Existing Metric Page

Below is a guide for the specific bank-relevant content to add to each of the 13 existing metric pages. This content populates the new expanded fields defined in Section 3.6.

**ROE (/metrics/roe)**
- Bank-Specific Context: Banks are inherently leveraged; ROE reflects both management quality AND leverage level. Regulatory capital requirements cap leverage and therefore constrain maximum ROE. A bank with 10:1 leverage and 1% ROA produces 10% ROE.
- Metric Connections: ROE = ROA Ã— Equity Multiplier (DuPont). ROE determines justified P/B ratio (ROE-P/B framework). P/B = P/E Ã— ROE. Sustainable growth rate = ROE Ã— retention ratio.
- Common Pitfalls: Very high ROE may indicate thin capital rather than superior management. One-time gains can inflate ROE temporarily. ROE is less meaningful during periods of elevated credit losses. Comparing ROE across banks with different leverage levels without adjusting is misleading.
- Across Bank Types: Money center banks typically target 12-15% ROE. Well-run community banks often achieve 10-13%. Banks with excess capital may show lower ROE despite strong operations.
- What Drives This Metric: Net income (numerator) is driven by NIM, fee income, efficiency, and provision expense. Equity (denominator) is driven by retained earnings, capital raises, buybacks, and regulatory requirements.

**ROAA (/metrics/roaa)**
- Bank-Specific Context: ROAA removes leverage from the equation, showing how productively the bank uses its asset base regardless of capital structure. This makes it more comparable across banks with different capital levels.
- Metric Connections: ROE = ROAA Ã— (Assets/Equity). If ROAA is strong but ROE is weak, the bank may be overcapitalized. ROAA combined with Equity to Assets reveals the leverage multiplier.
- Common Pitfalls: Asset size can be inflated by securities portfolios that earn low returns, dragging ROAA down even for operationally efficient banks. ROAA doesn't distinguish between loan-driven and securities-driven asset bases.
- What Drives This Metric: NIM on earning assets, non-interest income, operating efficiency, and credit losses.

**NIM (/metrics/net-interest-margin)**
- Bank-Specific Context: NIM is the single most important profitability driver for traditional banks. It measures the spread between what a bank earns on loans/investments and what it pays on deposits/borrowings relative to earning assets.
- Metric Connections: NIM is the largest component of ROAA for most banks. NIM Ã— earning assets = net interest income. NIM combined with the efficiency ratio determines how much of the spread flows to the bottom line.
- Common Pitfalls: Higher NIM can indicate riskier lending (subprime, high-yield CRE). Comparing NIM across banks with very different asset mixes is misleading. NIM is compressed during flat or inverted yield curves even at well-run banks.
- Across Bank Types: Community banks focused on relationship lending often achieve higher NIMs (3.5-4.5%) than money center banks (2.0-3.0%) whose asset mix includes more low-yield securities and wholesale lending.
- What Drives This Metric: Interest rate environment, yield curve shape, loan mix (CRE vs residential vs C&I), deposit mix (non-interest-bearing vs CDs), competition for deposits, pace of loan repricing.

**Efficiency Ratio (/metrics/efficiency-ratio)**
- Bank-Specific Context: For banks, the efficiency ratio specifically measures non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income (total revenue). Lower is better â€” it means less cost to generate each dollar of revenue.
- Metric Connections: Directly impacts net income and therefore ROE and ROAA. Efficiency ratio improvements are sometimes called the "efficiency dividend" in bank M&A analysis.
- Common Pitfalls: Different business lines have inherently different efficiency ratios. Wealth management divisions typically run 65-75% efficiency ratios but with high ROE due to low capital needs. Comparing a wealth-management-heavy bank to a pure lending bank on efficiency ratio alone is misleading.
- Across Bank Types: Large money center banks often achieve 55-60%. Well-run community banks target 55-65%. Banks under 50% are exceptional. Banks above 70% may have structural cost problems.
- What Drives This Metric: Salary and benefits expense (largest component), branch network costs, technology investment, regulatory compliance costs, revenue growth rate vs expense growth rate.

**P/B (/metrics/price-to-book)**
- Bank-Specific Context: P/B is the primary valuation metric for banks because bank assets are mostly financial instruments carried near fair value on the balance sheet, making book value a more meaningful measure of net asset value than for industrial companies.
- Metric Connections: Justified P/B = (ROE - g) / (r - g) where g is growth rate and r is cost of equity (ROE-P/B framework). P/B = P/E Ã— ROE. A bank trading at P/B of 1.0 with ROE of 12% implies P/E of ~8.3x.
- Common Pitfalls: Book value may not reflect true economic value due to held-to-maturity securities carried at amortized cost, understated loan loss reserves, or goodwill from acquisitions. P/B below 1.0 does not automatically mean undervalued â€” it may reflect the market pricing in asset quality problems, earnings weakness, or management concerns.
- Across Bank Types: High-performing banks with strong ROE and growth prospects may trade at 1.5-2.5x book. Average banks trade around 1.0-1.3x. Banks with asset quality concerns or weak earnings may trade below book value.

**P/E (/metrics/price-to-earnings)**
- Bank-Specific Context: P/E is useful for banks during normal earnings periods but becomes less reliable when credit losses spike (earnings become temporarily depressed) or during unusual gain events. It's best used alongside P/B.
- Metric Connections: P/E Ã— ROE = P/B. P/E captures the market's view of earnings power; P/B captures the market's view of asset value. Divergence between what P/E and P/B imply can signal opportunities.
- Common Pitfalls: Provision for credit losses makes bank earnings more volatile than most industries. A bank may have a high P/E simply because a spike in provisions temporarily depressed earnings. P/E is nearly useless for banks with negative or near-zero earnings.
- What Drives This Metric: Market sentiment, earnings growth expectations, interest rate outlook, perceived credit quality, overall market multiple levels.

**EPS (/metrics/earnings-per-share)**
- Bank-Specific Context: For banks, EPS is heavily influenced by provision for credit losses, which can swing significantly quarter to quarter. Preferred stock dividends must be subtracted from net income to arrive at EPS available to common shareholders â€” relevant because many banks have preferred shares outstanding.
- Metric Connections: EPS is the numerator input to P/E and one of two inputs to the Graham Number. EPS = ROE Ã— BVPS. TTM EPS calculated from quarterly filings may differ slightly from the annual 10-K figure due to timing of items.
- Common Pitfalls: Watch for basic vs diluted EPS â€” use diluted for investment analysis. One-time items (securities gains/losses, legal settlements, tax adjustments) can distort EPS in any given period. Comparing EPS across banks is meaningless without normalizing for share count.

**BVPS (/metrics/book-value-per-share)**
- Bank-Specific Context: BVPS represents the per-share accounting net asset value of the bank. For banks, this is more closely tied to economic value than for most industries because bank assets are primarily financial instruments.
- Metric Connections: BVPS is the denominator in P/B ratio and one of two inputs to the Graham Number. BVPS growth rate over time reflects retained earnings growth (internal capital generation). BVPS = Total Equity / Shares Outstanding.
- Common Pitfalls: BVPS includes intangible assets and goodwill, which may overstate tangible net asset value for banks that have made acquisitions. TBVPS strips these out for a more conservative view. AOCI (accumulated other comprehensive income/loss) can cause BVPS to fluctuate with unrealized securities gains/losses.

**Equity to Assets (/metrics/equity-to-assets)**
- Bank-Specific Context: This is the simplest measure of a bank's capital adequacy â€” the percentage of assets funded by equity rather than debt/deposits. Higher ratios indicate more capital cushion but may also indicate excess capital that could be deployed more productively.
- Metric Connections: The inverse of this ratio is the equity multiplier, which links ROAA to ROE (ROE = ROAA Ã— Assets/Equity). Equity to Assets provides a quick sanity check on leverage without the complexity of risk-weighted capital ratios.
- Common Pitfalls: Equity to Assets doesn't account for the riskiness of the asset base (unlike CET1 or Tier 1 ratios which use risk-weighted assets). A bank with 10% equity-to-assets invested entirely in US Treasuries is in a very different position than one with 10% invested heavily in subprime loans.
- Across Bank Types: Community banks often run 8-12%. Large banks may run lower (7-10%) due to more diversified asset bases and explicit regulatory capital management. De novo (new) banks often start with very high ratios (15%+) that decline as they grow their loan book.

**Loans to Deposits (/metrics/loans-to-deposits)**
- Bank-Specific Context: Measures how aggressively a bank is lending relative to its deposit base. A bank is essentially an intermediary that transforms deposits into loans, and this ratio measures the intensity of that transformation.
- Metric Connections: Combined with NIM, indicates whether the bank is effectively deploying its funding into higher-yielding loans. High L/D with high NIM suggests efficient intermediation.
- Common Pitfalls: Very high L/D (above 100%) means the bank is funding some loans with non-deposit sources (borrowings, bonds), which are typically more expensive and less stable. Very low L/D may indicate the bank is underutilizing its deposit base or investing heavily in securities rather than lending.
- What Drives This Metric: Loan demand in the bank's markets, management's appetite for growth, deposit growth, competition for loans and deposits.

**Deposits to Assets (/metrics/deposits-to-assets)**
- Bank-Specific Context: Measures how much of the bank's funding comes from customer deposits vs other sources (borrowings, equity, other liabilities). Higher ratios generally indicate more stable, lower-cost funding.
- Metric Connections: Combined with Cost of Funds/Cost of Deposits (new metric pages), indicates funding efficiency. Banks with high deposit-to-asset ratios and low cost of deposits have a structural profitability advantage.
- What Drives This Metric: Branch network, market share, deposit pricing strategy, mix of deposit types (non-interest-bearing checking is free funding; CDs are rate-sensitive).

**Loans to Assets (/metrics/loans-to-assets)**
- Bank-Specific Context: Indicates what portion of the bank's assets are deployed in loans (the core earning asset). The remainder is typically in securities, cash, and other assets.
- Metric Connections: Higher L/A ratios generally support higher NIM (loans yield more than securities) but also indicate higher credit risk exposure.
- Common Pitfalls: The ratio doesn't distinguish between loan types. A bank with 75% of assets in high-quality residential mortgages has a very different risk profile than one with 75% in construction loans.

**Dividend Payout Ratio (/metrics/dividend-payout-ratio)**
- Bank-Specific Context: For banks, the payout ratio must be evaluated in the context of regulatory capital requirements. Banks need to retain sufficient earnings to maintain and build capital ratios. Regulators can and do restrict dividends if capital levels are insufficient.
- Metric Connections: Retention ratio = 1 - Payout Ratio. Sustainable growth rate = ROE Ã— Retention Ratio. A bank paying out 40% of earnings retains 60%, and if ROE is 12%, sustainable growth is 7.2%.
- Common Pitfalls: A low payout ratio isn't always good â€” it may indicate the bank cannot safely pay more, or that it's retaining earnings to rebuild capital after losses. A high payout ratio may be sustainable if ROE is strong but could be dangerous if earnings are about to decline.
- What Drives This Metric: Board dividend policy, regulatory capital buffers, earnings stability, growth needs, share buyback preferences.

### 6.2 Implementation Note for Claude Code

The existing data structures in `metrics.js` and `valuations.js` have specific required fields. All new fields must be added alongside the existing fields without breaking the current structure.

**Current exact metric data structure (from `src/data/content/metrics.js`):**

```javascript
{
  slug: 'roe',                    // URL path segment, kebab-case
  name: 'Return on Equity (ROE)', // Display name with abbreviation in parens
  category: 'profitability',      // One of: profitability, efficiency, capital, valuation, per-share
  categoryLabel: 'Profitability Ratio',  // Human-readable category
  formula: 'ROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders\' Equity',
  isPercentage: true,             // Optional
  shortDescription: '...',        // One sentence, used in meta tags and index cards. No trailing period.
  description: '...',             // 2-3 sentences, full overview
  formulaExplanation: '...',      // How the inputs are calculated
  interpretation: '...',          // What the number means
  typicalRange: '...',            // Normal values for banks
  goodBad: {
    good: '...',                  // What favorable values look like
    bad: '...',                   // What concerning values look like
  },
  considerations: ['...', '...'], // Array of exactly 4 items
  relatedMetrics: ['roaa', 'efficiency-ratio'],  // Slugs of related metrics
  relatedMetricDescriptions: {
    'roaa': 'Why this metric relates to ROAA...',  // One sentence per related metric
  },
  dataSource: '...',              // Where the data comes from (SEC filings)
}
```

**New fields to add to each existing metric entry (all optional, render conditionally):**

```javascript
{
  // ... all existing fields above remain unchanged ...

  // NEW EXPANSION FIELDS:
  bankSpecificContext: '...',      // Why this metric is different/special for banks
  metricConnections: '...',       // How this metric relates to other metrics, include formulas
  commonPitfalls: '...',          // Misreadings and traps specific to bank analysis
  acrossBankTypes: '...',         // How metric differs for community vs regional vs money center banks
  whatDrivesMetric: '...',        // Factors that cause the metric to move
  whereToFindData: '...',         // For educational-only metrics: where investors can find this data
  isEducationalOnly: false,       // true for metrics not in screener (new metrics only)
  faqTeasers: [                   // 2-3 FAQ teasers with links
    {
      question: 'What is a good ROE for a bank?',
      teaser: 'Well-managed banks typically achieve ROE between 8% and 15%...',
      faqSlug: 'what-is-a-good-roe-for-banks',
      faqCluster: 'profitability'
    }
  ]
}
```

**For new metric entries (23 new metrics from Section 4):** Include ALL existing required fields plus the new expansion fields. New metrics will use expanded categories: `profitability`, `efficiency`, `capital`, `asset-quality`, `valuation`, `per-share`, `balance-sheet`. The `categoryLabel` field should use the human-readable names from Section 4's updated categorization.

**For educational-only metrics:** Set `isEducationalOnly: true`. Replace `dataSource` with `whereToFindData` explaining where investors can find this metric (FDIC call reports, bank 10-K/10-Q, Federal Reserve FR Y-9C, etc.). The template component should suppress screener CTAs for these metrics.

**Current exact valuation data structure (from `src/data/content/valuations.js`):**

```javascript
{
  slug: 'graham-number',
  name: 'Graham Number',
  type: 'Intrinsic Value Method',  // One of: Intrinsic Value Method, Relative Valuation Method,
                                    //         Risk Management Concept, Fundamental Valuation Method
  shortDescription: '...',          // No trailing period
  description: '...',
  formula: '...',
  isPercentage: true,               // Optional
  formulaExplanation: '...',
  steps: ['Step 1...', 'Step 2...'],  // Array of exactly 5 ordered steps
  example: '...',                     // Worked example with specific numbers
  strengths: ['...', '...'],          // Array of exactly 4 items
  limitations: ['...', '...'],        // Array of 4-5 items
  bankSpecific: '...',                // Why this matters specifically for banks
  relatedMethods: ['margin-of-safety', 'price-to-book-valuation'],  // Slugs of related valuations
}
```

**New fields to add to each existing valuation entry:**

```javascript
{
  // ... all existing fields above remain unchanged ...

  // NEW EXPANSION FIELDS:
  whenToUse: '...',               // When this method is most/least appropriate for bank valuation
  methodConnections: '...',       // How this method relates to other valuation approaches
  commonMistakes: '...',          // Typical errors investors make applying this method to banks
  acrossBankTypes: '...',         // How the method applies differently across bank types
  faqTeasers: [                   // 2-3 FAQ teasers with links
    {
      question: 'How do I calculate the Graham Number for bank stocks?',
      teaser: 'The Graham Number estimates maximum fair price using EPS and BVPS...',
      faqSlug: 'graham-number-for-bank-stocks',
      faqCluster: 'valuation'
    }
  ]
}
```

**Critical conventions (from Claude Code):**
- Slugs are kebab-case and must be unique across their data array
- Descriptions use second/third person ("It measures...", "The ratio shows..."), not first/second person
- `considerations` arrays are exactly 4 items
- `steps` arrays are exactly 5 items
- `strengths` arrays are exactly 4 items
- `limitations` arrays are 4-5 items
- `relatedMetrics` / `relatedMethods` must reference existing valid slugs
- All text is plain strings (no HTML or markdown inside the values)
- No trailing periods on `shortDescription`; other fields use full sentences with periods

### 6.3 Cross-Linking Requirements

Beyond the `relatedMetrics` and `relatedMethods` fields inside the data arrays, there are two cross-link maps in `scripts/prerender.mjs`:

```javascript
// Maps metric slugs to arrays of related valuation slugs
const METRIC_TO_VALUATIONS = {
  'roe': ['roe-pb-framework', 'peer-comparison', 'dividend-discount-model'],
  // ...
};

// Maps valuation slugs to arrays of related metric slugs
const VALUATION_TO_METRICS = {
  'graham-number': ['earnings-per-share', 'book-value-per-share', 'price-to-book', 'price-to-earnings'],
  // ...
};
```

**There are only two maps (slug arrays). There are NO separate description maps.** Per-metric relationship descriptions come from `relatedMetricDescriptions` on each metric entry in `metrics.js`. The prerender script falls back to `shortDescription` if no description is provided: `const desc = metric.relatedMetricDescriptions?.[slug] || related.shortDescription;`

**Important:** These maps live in `prerender.mjs`, NOT in any React component. When adding new metrics or valuations, update these maps in `prerender.mjs`.

**When content is generated, it must include:**
1. Slug arrays for `METRIC_TO_VALUATIONS` entries for each new metric (which valuation methods relate to it)
2. Slug arrays for `VALUATION_TO_METRICS` entries for each new valuation (which metrics relate to it)
3. Updates to existing map entries if new valuations should link to existing metrics or vice versa
4. `relatedMetricDescriptions` entries on each new metric for its related metrics (one sentence per related metric)

Terms are organized into 10 categories (each with 7+ terms): profitability-efficiency, capital-regulatory, credit-quality, valuation, income-statement, funding-deposits, banking-industry, investment-analysis, balance-sheet-accounting, data-sources. `METRIC_CATEGORY_OVERRIDES` remaps certain auto-generated terms to correct categories (e.g., EPS and Dividend Payout Ratio to income-statement). When new metrics or valuations are added to the data arrays, they automatically appear in the glossary. New manual terms should be added to `ADDITIONAL_TERMS` with the appropriate category slug.

## 8. FAQ Content: Complete Question List by Cluster

### Data Structure and URL Pattern

See Section 13.3 for the complete FAQ data structure, field conventions, and cluster definitions.

**URL structure (flat -- no cluster in URL):**

```
/faq                                    -> FAQ main index (all clusters listed as sections)
/faq/what-are-bank-stocks               -> Individual FAQ page
/faq/what-is-a-good-roe-for-banks       -> Individual FAQ page
/faq/how-to-calculate-roe               -> "How to Calculate" FAQ page
```

**Important:** There are NO cluster index pages. `/faq/getting-started` does not exist as a route. Clusters are a data-level grouping used for display on the `/faq` index page only. All FAQ detail pages use the flat pattern `/faq/:faqSlug`.

## 9. "How to Calculate" FAQ Pages

Every metric (existing and new, 36 total) gets a dedicated "How to Calculate" FAQ page. These pages are part of the FAQ system (stored in the `faqs.js` data array) but belong to the cluster that corresponds to their metric category.

### Purpose and Content Structure

Each "How to Calculate" FAQ page should be distinct from the metric page itself:

| Metric Page Covers | "How to Calculate" FAQ Covers |
|---|---|
| What the metric is | Step-by-step primary formula with worked example |
| Why it matters for banks | Alternative formulas when certain inputs aren't available |
| How to interpret values | Where to find each input in actual SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, call reports) |
| Typical ranges | Bank-specific calculation nuances and adjustments |
| Related metrics | Related metric relationships expressed as formulas |
| | Common calculation mistakes |
| | Basic vs adjusted versions (when applicable) |

### Content Sizing Guidance

Page length should match available depth. Metrics with multiple alternative calculation methods, bank-specific adjustments, and meaningful formula relationships (like ROE, P/B, NIM) will naturally produce longer pages. Metrics with straightforward single formulas (like EPS, BVPS) should still be created but can be shorter, with the additional content focusing on bank-specific nuances, connections to other metrics, and where to find the inputs.

### 10.2 Cross-Cluster Linking Map

This shows which clusters should link to each other, creating a web of topically related content.

```
Cluster 1  (Getting)       â†’ 2 (next step: understand financials), 3 (next step: learn metrics), 6 (next step: valuation), 10 (next step: use screener)
Cluster 2  (Statements)    â†’ 1 (if arriving from search, may need basics), 3 (metrics derived from these statements), 5 (capital concepts)
Cluster 3  (Profitability) â†’ 4 (efficiency drives profitability), 6 (profitability informs valuation), 8 (rates affect profitability)

```

### 10.3 "How to Calculate" Pages Linking Map

Each "How to Calculate" FAQ page links to:
1. The corresponding metric page (primary â€” "Learn more about {metric}")
2. Metric pages for all related/connected metrics mentioned in the alternative methods
3. The glossary for any terms that may be unfamiliar
4. 2-3 other "How to Calculate" pages for the most closely connected metrics
5. The screener (only if the metric is a screener filter)

## 11. Cannibalization Management

### 11.1 Existing FAQs Converted to Teasers (COMPLETE)

**Homepage (6 existing FAQs) -- DONE:**

| Current Question | Action | Link To |
|---|---|---|
| What is BankSift? | Kept as-is (product-specific) | N/A |
| Which financial metrics can I track? | Shortened to teaser | /faq/most-important-bank-stock-metrics |
| How can I compare bank stocks? | Shortened to teaser | /faq/how-to-compare-bank-stocks |
| Is BankSift free to use? | Kept as-is (product-specific) | N/A |
| Where does BankSift get its data? | Kept as-is (product-specific) | N/A |
| How do I find the best bank stocks? | Shortened to teaser | /faq/filters-for-high-quality-banks |

**Valuation page (3 existing FAQs) -- DONE:**

| Current Question | Action | Link To |
|---|---|---|

| What is the Graham Number in bank valuation? | Shortened to teaser | /faq/graham-number-for-bank-stocks |
| Which valuation methods are best for banks? | Shortened to teaser | /faq/why-bank-valuation-is-different |

### 11.2 FAQ Teasers on Metric and Valuation Pages (COMPLETE)

Each metric and valuation page displays 2-3 FAQ teasers from the `faqTeasers` array field in the data entry. The teaser format is:

```
Q: {question text}
A: {1-2 sentence abbreviated answer}... Read more
```

The "Read more" link goes to `/faq/:faqSlug` (flat URL). The `faqCluster` field in `faqTeasers` is retained for organizational reference but is NOT used in URL construction.

### 11.3 FAQ Section Links (COMPLETE)

The following links were added in Phase 1:
- **Site navigation** -- FAQ link under "Learn" group
- **Homepage** "What You Can Do" section -- FAQ & Learning Center entry
- **Valuation hub page** -- FAQ teasers with "Read more" links
- **Metric/valuation detail pages** -- FAQ teasers from data arrays

---

## 12. Content Tone & Style Guidelines

### Voice and Tone

All content across FAQ pages, metric pages, valuation pages, and glossary entries should maintain a **neutral, professional, educational tone** consistent with the existing BankSift content.

**General principles:**
- Write in second/third person ("It measures...", "The ratio shows...", "Investors should consider..."). Never first person ("I think...", "We believe...").
- Maintain an authoritative but accessible voice. The site is a reference tool, not an opinion platform.
- Do not hedge excessively. State facts clearly and provide ranges/context rather than qualifying every sentence.
- Avoid filler phrases ("It's important to note that...", "It's worth mentioning that..."). Get to the substance.

**For beginner-oriented content (Clusters 1, 2, 9; introductory sections of metric pages):**
- Use accessible language. Define terms on first use or link to the glossary.
- Use concrete examples and plain descriptions over jargon.
- Keep sentences and paragraphs short.
- Explain the "why" and "so what" explicitly rather than assuming the reader can infer it.

**For intermediate content (Clusters 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10; main body of metric/valuation pages):**
- Assume familiarity with basic financial concepts (what a stock is, what a ratio is).
- Use standard financial terminology without excessive definition.
- Balance explanation with depth. The reader wants to understand the concept well enough to use it.

**For advanced content (Clusters 5, 11; "Metric Connections" and "Across Bank Types" sections):**
- Assume the reader has working knowledge of bank financial statements and core metrics.
- Use precise terminology. Readers at this level expect specificity.
- Focus on nuance, connections between concepts, and practical application.

### Writing Style Rules

- **No em dashes.** Use commas, semicolons, parentheses, or separate sentences instead.
- **No exclamation points.**
- **No rhetorical questions** as a stylistic device (FAQ questions themselves are obviously questions).
- **No "importantly," "interestingly," "notably," "essentially," "fundamentally," "ultimately," "certainly."**
- **No "This is because..." constructions.** Restructure to state the reason directly.
- **No "In other words..." or "Put simply..."** Just state it clearly the first time.
- **No "it is worth noting" or "it should be noted."** Just state the point.
- **Avoid passive voice** where active voice is clearer, but do not avoid it so aggressively that sentences become awkward.
- **Use "that" rather than "which" for restrictive clauses** (banks that have high ROE, not banks which have high ROE).
- **Numbers:** Spell out one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above. Always use numerals with units (5%, 3.5x, $1 billion). Use "%" not "percent" in technical content.

### Content Structure Rules

- **All text values are plain strings.** No HTML, no Markdown, no special formatting inside data array fields. Claude Code's templates handle all rendering.
- **No trailing periods on `shortDescription` fields.** All other text fields use complete sentences with periods.
- **Descriptions use second/third person.** Never "you should" or "we recommend."
- **`considerations` arrays are exactly 4 items. `steps` arrays are exactly 5 items. `strengths` arrays are exactly 4 items. `limitations` arrays are 4-5 items.** These constraints come from the existing template components and prerender script.

## 13. Exact Data Structures & Cross-Linking Requirements

### 13.1 Metric Data Structure

See Section 6.2 for the complete existing and expanded metric data structure with all field names, types, and conventions.

### 13.2 Valuation Data Structure

See Section 6.2 for the complete existing and expanded valuation data structure with all field names, types, and conventions.

### 13.3 FAQ Data Structure

Each FAQ entry in the new data file (`src/data/content/faqs.js`) follows this structure:

```javascript
{
  slug: 'what-are-bank-stocks',
  question: 'What are bank stocks and how do they differ from other stocks?',
  cluster: 'getting-started',
  clusterName: 'Getting Started with Bank Stocks',
  intentType: 'definitional', // definitional | evaluative | comparative | procedural | strategic | conceptual

  // Content fields
  shortAnswer: 'Brief 1-2 sentence answer for teasers and meta descriptions. No trailing period',
  fullAnswer: 'Complete answer content. Multiple paragraphs separated by \\n\\n. Plain text only, no HTML or Markdown. Should be 300-800 words depending on topic depth. See Section 3.5 for structure based on intent type.',

  // Linking fields
  relatedMetrics: ['roe', 'price-to-book'],            // Slugs from metrics.js
  relatedValuations: ['price-to-book-valuation'],       // Slugs from valuations.js
  relatedFaqs: ['why-invest-in-bank-stocks', 'how-do-banks-make-money'], // Slugs of other FAQ entries
  relatedGlossaryTerms: ['Bank Holding Company', 'SIC Code'], // Terms as they appear in glossary

  // CTA field
  cta: {
    type: 'screener',  // screener | search | learn-metric | learn-valuation | learn-faq | glossary
    target: '/screener', // URL path
    text: 'Screen 300+ bank stocks by ROE and other metrics' // CTA button/link text
  },

  // SEO fields
  metaTitle: 'What Are Bank Stocks? How They Differ From Other Stocks | BankSift',
  metaDescription: 'Learn what bank stocks are, how they differ from other stocks, and why bank financial analysis requires specialized metrics and valuation methods'
}
```

**Cluster definitions:**

```javascript
const FAQ_CLUSTERS = [
  { slug: 'getting-started', name: 'Getting Started with Bank Stocks', order: 1 },
  { slug: 'financial-statements', name: 'Understanding Bank Financial Statements', order: 2 },
  { slug: 'profitability', name: 'Bank Profitability Metrics', order: 3 },
  { slug: 'efficiency', name: 'Bank Efficiency and Funding', order: 4 },
  { slug: 'capital-and-risk', name: 'Capital Strength and Asset Quality', order: 5 },
  { slug: 'valuation', name: 'How to Value Bank Stocks', order: 6 },
  { slug: 'dividends', name: 'Bank Dividends and Shareholder Returns', order: 7 },
  { slug: 'interest-rates', name: 'Interest Rates and Bank Performance', order: 8 },
  { slug: 'bank-types', name: 'Understanding Bank Types', order: 9 },
  { slug: 'screening', name: 'Screening and Analysis Strategies', order: 10 },
  { slug: 'advanced', name: 'Advanced Bank Analysis', order: 11 },
];
```

**FAQ data conventions:**
- Slugs are kebab-case and unique across the entire FAQS array
- `shortAnswer` has no trailing period; `fullAnswer` uses complete sentences with periods
- `fullAnswer` uses plain text with `\n\n` for paragraph breaks; no HTML or Markdown
- `relatedMetrics`, `relatedValuations`, and `relatedFaqs` slugs must reference valid existing entries
- `metaTitle` should be under 60 characters where possible, always ends with "| BankSift"
- `metaDescription` should be 120-160 characters

**Critical URL convention:** FAQ URLs are flat: `/faq/:faqSlug`. The `cluster` field is for data grouping and display on the FAQ index page only. It is NOT used in URL construction. The `faqSlug` field in `faqTeasers` on metric/valuation pages links directly to `/faq/:faqSlug`. The `faqCluster` field in `faqTeasers` is retained for organizational reference but is not used in URL construction.

### 13.4 Cross-Linking Requirements

See Section 6.3 for the cross-linking map requirements between metrics and valuations. The cross-link maps (`METRIC_TO_VALUATIONS`, `VALUATION_TO_METRICS`, and their description maps) live in `scripts/prerender.mjs`.

**For FAQ pages:** Cross-links are handled through the `relatedMetrics`, `relatedValuations`, `relatedFaqs`, and `relatedGlossaryTerms` fields in each FAQ entry. No separate cross-link maps are needed; the FAQ template component and prerender script read these fields directly. Note that `relatedGlossaryTerms` renders as a generic "See the glossary" link (per-term glossary badges were removed during Phase 1).

### 13.5 Content Handoff Format

All content will be generated as **JavaScript objects** matching the exact field names and conventions above. Content will be organized into separate deliverable files:

1. **Metric content:** Complete JavaScript objects for new metrics + cross-link map entries for `prerender.mjs`
2. **Valuation content:** Complete JavaScript objects for new valuations + cross-link map entries for `prerender.mjs`
3. **FAQ content:** Complete JavaScript objects for FAQ entries (standard + "How to Calculate"), organized by cluster
4. **Glossary content:** New manual terms for `ADDITIONAL_TERMS` in `Glossary.jsx`, with category assignments

Each deliverable file will contain drop-in-ready JavaScript that Claude Code can insert directly into the appropriate source files.

## 14. Implementation Workflow & Content Generation Plan

### 14.1 Three-Step Process

**Step 1: Content Generation (in this Claude Project)**
Generate all content as structured JavaScript objects matching the exact data structures in Section 13. Content is generated in batches following the phased rollout order. All content is generated before implementation begins.

**Step 2: Claude Code Implementation**
Provide Claude Code with the strategy document (this document) and all generated content from Step 1. Claude Code implements everything together: creates new files, modifies existing files, updates routing, prerender script, and sitemap generator. Claude Code then verifies the build completes without errors.

**Step 3: Review and Verification**
Review the deployed website here for content accuracy, missing content, broken links, incorrect rendering, and overall quality. Fetch and inspect pages to verify pre-rendered HTML, meta tags, and structured data. Identify any errors, omissions, or issues for Claude Code to fix.

### 14.2 Content Generation Batches

**Batch 1 (Phase 1 -- COMPLETE):**
- Expansion fields for all 13 existing metric entries -- DONE
- Expansion fields for all 7 existing valuation entries -- DONE
- Cross-link map entries for existing metrics/valuations -- DONE
- Cluster 1 FAQ content (Getting Started, 15 questions) -- DONE
- Cluster 3 FAQ content (Profitability, 13 questions) -- DONE
- Cluster 6 FAQ content (Valuation, 17 questions) -- DONE
- Cluster 10 FAQ content (Screening, 14 questions) -- DONE
- "How to Calculate" FAQ content for all 13 existing metrics -- DONE
- Updated homepage FAQ teasers -- DONE
- Updated valuation page FAQ teasers -- DONE

**Batch 2 (Phase 2 depth):**
- All 23 new metric entries (complete objects with all required and expansion fields)
- All 5 new valuation entries (complete objects with all required and expansion fields)
- Cross-link map entries for all new metrics and valuations (for `prerender.mjs`)
- Cluster 4 FAQ content (Efficiency, 11 standard questions)
- Cluster 5 FAQ content (Capital and Risk, 17 standard questions)
- Cluster 7 FAQ content (Dividends, 10 standard questions)
- Cluster 8 FAQ content (Interest Rates, 10 standard questions)
- "How to Calculate" FAQ content for all 23 new metrics
- New glossary terms (for `ADDITIONAL_TERMS` in Glossary.jsx, with category assignments)

**Batch 3 (Phase 3 coverage):**
- Cluster 2 FAQ content (Financial Statements, 17 questions)
- Cluster 9 FAQ content (Bank Types, 10 questions)
- Cluster 11 FAQ content (Advanced, 14 questions)

### 14.3 Content Generation Session Setup

**Settings for content generation sessions:**
- Web search: OFF (research phase is complete; search during generation introduces non-evergreen content risk and noise)
- Code execution: ON (for generating and validating structured data files)
- Artifacts: ON (for presenting content files for review)

**Prompting approach:**
Content generation prompts will be provided within this same Project. Each prompt will specify the batch or sub-batch to generate and reference this strategy document for all guidelines. The prompt structure will follow this pattern:

1. Specify which content batch to generate (e.g., "Generate Cluster 1 FAQ content")
2. Reference the strategy document sections for guidelines (tone, data sourcing, evergreen rules, search intent, CTA types)
3. Reference the exact data structure from Section 13
4. Request output as ready-to-use JavaScript objects

Generated content will be delivered as downloadable files containing JavaScript objects that can be handed directly to Claude Code.

### 14.4 Content Volume Summary

**Completed (Batch 1 / Phase 1):**

| Content Type | Count | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Existing metric expansions | 13 entries | DONE |
| Existing valuation expansions | 7 entries | DONE |
| Phase 1 FAQ pages | 72 entries | DONE |
| Cross-link map entries | All existing | DONE |
| Homepage/valuation teasers | 6 entries | DONE |
| Glossary expansion | ~96 terms | DONE |

**Remaining (Batches 2 & 3 / Phases 2 & 3):**

| Content Type | Count | Approx. Words Each | Total Approx. Words |
|---|---|---|---|
| New metric entries | 23 complete entries | 500-800 per entry | 12,000-18,000 |
| New valuation entries | 5 complete entries | 600-1,000 per entry | 3,000-5,000 |
| Remaining standard FAQ pages | 76 entries | 300-800 per entry | 23,000-61,000 |
| "How to Calculate" for new metrics | 23 entries | 300-600 per entry | 7,000-14,000 |
| Cross-link map entries for new content | ~50 entries | 15-25 per entry | 750-1,250 |
| **Remaining Total** | | | **~46,000-99,000 words** |

This will require multiple content generation sessions across Batches 2 and 3.

## 15. Claude Code Implementation Instructions

### 15.1 What Already Exists (Phase 1 Complete)

The following infrastructure is in place and working:

**Files created in Phase 1:**
- `src/data/content/faqs.js` -- exports `FAQ_CLUSTERS` (11 clusters) and `FAQS` (72 entries)
- `src/pages/FaqIndex.jsx` -- FAQ main index at `/faq`
- `src/pages/FaqDetail.jsx` -- individual FAQ pages at `/faq/:faqSlug`

**Files modified in Phase 1:**
- `src/App.jsx` -- FAQ routes added (`/faq` and `/faq/:faqSlug`)
- `src/data/content/metrics.js` -- all 13 entries extended with expansion fields
- `src/data/content/valuations.js` -- all 7 entries extended with expansion fields
- `scripts/prerender.mjs` -- pre-renders all FAQ pages, metric/valuation expansion sections, cross-link maps, JSON-LD schema
- `scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs` -- enumerates all FAQ routes
- `src/pages/Glossary.jsx` -- ~96 terms across 10 categories with auto-generation from data arrays
- Homepage component -- FAQ teasers shortened with "Read more" links, FAQ added to "What You Can Do"
- Valuation index -- FAQ teasers shortened with "Read more" links
- Navigation -- FAQ link added under "Learn" group

**Architecture decisions made in Phase 1 (do not change):**
- FAQ URLs are flat (`/faq/:faqSlug`), no cluster index pages
- JSON-LD schema defined ONLY in `prerender.mjs`, not in React components
- Cross-link maps (`METRIC_TO_VALUATIONS`, `VALUATION_TO_METRICS`) live in `prerender.mjs` -- these are slug arrays only, no separate description maps
- Glossary auto-generates entries from METRICS and VALUATION_METHODS arrays; manual terms in `ADDITIONAL_TERMS`
- `METRIC_CATEGORY_OVERRIDES` in Glossary.jsx remaps auto-generated terms to correct glossary categories
- Empty FAQ clusters are hidden on the FAQ index page

### 15.2 Adding New Content (Phase 2 & 3)

**To add new FAQ entries:**
1. Add entries to the `FAQS` array in `src/data/content/faqs.js`
2. Assign to appropriate cluster via the `cluster` field
3. The existing FaqDetail.jsx, FaqIndex.jsx, prerender block, and sitemap generator handle everything else
4. Clusters with 0 questions are hidden; they will appear automatically when content is added

**To add new metric pages (23 planned):**
1. Add entries to the `METRICS` array in `src/data/content/metrics.js` with ALL required fields (see Section 6.2 for complete structure) plus expansion fields
2. Add entries to `METRIC_TO_VALUATIONS` map in `prerender.mjs` (slug array of related valuations)
3. Add `relatedMetricDescriptions` entries on the metric for each of its `relatedMetrics` (one sentence per related metric, used by prerender.mjs with fallback to `shortDescription`)
4. The existing MetricDetail.jsx, prerender block, and sitemap generator handle page rendering

**To add new valuation method pages (5 planned):**
1. Add entries to the `VALUATION_METHODS` array in `src/data/content/valuations.js` with ALL required fields (see Section 6.2) plus expansion fields
2. Add entries to `VALUATION_TO_METRICS` map in `prerender.mjs` (slug array of related metrics)
3. Update existing `METRIC_TO_VALUATIONS` entries to include the new valuation slug where appropriate
4. The existing ValuationDetail.jsx, prerender block, and sitemap generator handle page rendering

**To add new glossary terms:**
1. Add entries to `ADDITIONAL_TERMS` array in `src/pages/Glossary.jsx` with `term`, `definition`, and `category` fields
2. Use one of the 10 existing categories: profitability-efficiency, capital-regulatory, credit-quality, valuation, income-statement, funding-deposits, banking-industry, investment-analysis, balance-sheet-accounting, data-sources
3. Each category should maintain 7+ terms for balanced display

### 15.3 Required Infrastructure Changes for Phase 2 (Claude Code Must Build)

Phase 2 introduces new metric categories and educational-only metrics that require infrastructure changes beyond just adding data entries. Claude Code must implement the following alongside the content:

**1. MetricsIndex.jsx: Add new categories.**

MetricsIndex.jsx has HARDCODED categories. The current 5 categories are: `profitability`, `efficiency`, `capital`, `valuation`, `per-share`. Phase 2 adds metrics with new category values: `asset-quality` and `balance-sheet`.

Claude Code must:
- Add new entries to the `categories` array with appropriate `key`, `title`, `description`, and `metrics: METRICS.filter(...)` for `asset-quality` and `balance-sheet`
- Add new entries to `CATEGORY_ICONS` for the new categories (create or reuse appropriate icons)
- Add entries to `TYPICAL_RANGE_SHORT` for any new metrics that have standard ranges (educational-only metrics may not need this)
- Add entries to `QUICK_REFERENCE` for new metrics that should appear in the quick reference table (likely only metrics that are in the screener; educational-only metrics should probably be excluded)

**2. MetricDetail.jsx: Add educational-only metric handling.**

`isEducationalOnly` and `whereToFindData` do NOT currently exist in the codebase. All metrics currently get the same rendering path including a screener CTA. Phase 2 adds 23 metrics that are all educational-only (not available in the screener).

Claude Code must:
- Add conditional logic to MetricDetail.jsx: when `metric.isEducationalOnly === true`, suppress the screener CTA
- Add conditional rendering for a "Where to Find This Data" section: when `metric.whereToFindData` is present and non-empty, render it (in place of or alongside `dataSource`)
- Add corresponding pre-render logic in `prerender.mjs` for educational-only metrics

**3. Glossary.jsx: Add auto-mapping for new metric categories.**

The glossary auto-mapping logic in `Glossary.jsx` currently handles: `profitability` and `efficiency` -> `profitability-efficiency`, `capital` -> `capital-regulatory`. It does not handle `asset-quality` or `balance-sheet`.

Claude Code must add mapping rules:
- `asset-quality` -> `credit-quality` (the existing glossary category for credit/risk terms)
- `balance-sheet` -> `balance-sheet-accounting` (the existing glossary category)

Or add these to `METRIC_CATEGORY_OVERRIDES` for specific metrics if a blanket rule is not appropriate.

### 15.4 Build Verification

After implementing changes, verify:
1. `npm run build` completes without errors
2. All new routes render correctly in the browser
3. Pre-rendered HTML files exist for all new routes (check page count output)
4. Sitemap includes all new URLs
5. Internal links between FAQ pages, metric pages, valuation pages resolve correctly
6. Existing pages still function correctly (no regressions)
7. FAQ teasers on metric/valuation pages link to correct `/faq/:faqSlug` URLs
8. Educational-only metric pages do NOT include screener CTAs and DO show "Where to Find This Data"
9. New metrics/valuations appear in glossary with correct categories
10. Cross-link maps in `prerender.mjs` include new entries
11. MetricsIndex shows new categories with correct titles, descriptions, and icons
12. New category metrics appear on MetricsIndex page under their correct section

5. Full sitemap and pre-render verification

**Estimated new pages in Phase 3: ~41** FAQ pages
**Projected total after Phase 3: ~584 pages**

### Content to Defer to Future Blog/Insights Section (Not Part of This Implementation)

The following topics were identified during planning but are better suited to a blog or insights section due to their time-sensitive, narrative, or analytical nature:

- History and evolution of Basel III capital requirements
