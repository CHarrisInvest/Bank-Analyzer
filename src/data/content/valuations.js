    name: 'Graham Number',
    type: 'Intrinsic Value Method',
    shortDescription: 'A value investing formula for estimating the maximum fair price based on earnings and book value.',
    description: 'The Graham Number is a valuation formula popularized by Benjamin Graham, often called the father of value investing. It calculates the maximum price a defensive investor should pay for a stock based on its earnings per share and book value per share. The formula assumes that a stock should not trade at more than 1.5 times book value or 15 times earnings.',
    formula: 'Graham Number = √(22.5 × EPS × BVPS)',
    formulaExplanation: 'The constant 22.5 comes from multiplying the maximum P/E ratio of 15 by the maximum P/B ratio of 1.5 (15 × 1.5 = 22.5). EPS is Earnings Per Share and BVPS is Book Value Per Share.',
    steps: [
      'Calculate the trailing twelve month Earnings Per Share (EPS).',
      'Calculate the Book Value Per Share (BVPS) from the latest balance sheet.',
      'Multiply EPS by BVPS and then by 22.5.',
      'Take the square root of the result to get the Graham Number.',
      'Compare the Graham Number to the current stock price.',
    ],
    example: 'For a bank with EPS of $4.00 and BVPS of $40.00: Graham Number = √(22.5 × 4.00 × 40.00) = √3,600 = $60.00. If the stock trades at $48, it may be undervalued relative to the Graham Number.',
    strengths: [
      'Provides a clear, objective price target based on fundamentals.',
      'Combines both earnings power and asset value considerations.',
      'Simple to calculate and understand.',
      'Time-tested methodology from a legendary investor.',
    ],
    limitations: [
      'Does not account for growth prospects or quality differences.',
      'May undervalue high-quality growth companies.',
      'Requires both positive earnings and positive book value.',
      'Does not consider interest rate environment or competitive dynamics.',
      'The 22.5 constant may not be appropriate for all market conditions.',
    ],
    bankSpecific: 'The Graham Number is particularly applicable to bank stocks because banks typically trade based on book value and earnings multiples. However, the formula does not account for differences in asset quality, capital requirements, or growth prospects that distinguish high-quality banks from weaker ones.',

    slug: 'margin-of-safety',
    name: 'Margin of Safety',
    type: 'Risk Management Concept',
    shortDescription: 'The discount between intrinsic value and purchase price that provides a buffer against errors.',
    description: 'Margin of Safety is a core principle of value investing that suggests buying securities only when their market price is significantly below their intrinsic value. This gap provides protection against analytical errors, unforeseen events, and market volatility. The concept was central to Benjamin Graham\'s investment philosophy.',
    formula: 'Margin of Safety = (Intrinsic Value - Current Price) / Intrinsic Value',
    isPercentage: true,
    formulaExplanation: 'Intrinsic Value can be calculated using various methods such as the Graham Number. The margin represents how much cushion exists between your purchase price and estimated fair value.',
    steps: [
      'Estimate the intrinsic value using your preferred method (Graham Number, DCF, etc.).',
      'Compare the intrinsic value to the current market price.',
      'Calculate the percentage difference.',
      'Determine if the margin is sufficient for your risk tolerance (typically 20-50%).',
      'Only purchase if the margin of safety meets your criteria.',
    ],
    example: 'If a bank\'s Graham Number is $60 and the stock trades at $45: Margin of Safety = ($60 - $45) / $60 = 25%. This 25% margin provides cushion against valuation errors.',
    strengths: [
      'Provides explicit risk management framework.',
      'Encourages disciplined, patient investing.',
      'Protects against valuation errors and unforeseen events.',
      'Can be applied with any intrinsic value methodology.',
    ],
    limitations: [
      'Requires accurate intrinsic value estimate to be meaningful.',
      'May cause investors to miss opportunities in fairly valued quality companies.',
      'No guarantee that price will converge to intrinsic value.',
      'Subjective determination of what margin is "enough."',
    ],
    bankSpecific: 'When applying margin of safety to banks, investors should consider that book values may not fully reflect true economic value. Loan loss reserves, held-to-maturity securities at historical cost, and other accounting items can cause reported book value to differ from liquidation value.',

    name: 'Price to Book Valuation',
    type: 'Relative Valuation Method',
    shortDescription: 'Valuing banks based on the ratio of market price to accounting book value.',
    description: 'Price to Book (P/B) valuation is the primary relative valuation method for banks. Unlike industrial companies where enterprise value multiples are common, banks are typically valued based on their equity book value because their business involves lending and borrowing money. A bank\'s book value represents its net worth - what shareholders would theoretically receive in liquidation.',
    formula: 'Target Price = Target P/B Multiple × Book Value Per Share',
    formulaExplanation: 'The target P/B multiple is determined by comparing to peers, historical averages, and the relationship between P/B and profitability (ROE).',
    steps: [
      'Calculate the current Book Value Per Share.',
      'Analyze the bank\'s Return on Equity (ROE) relative to peers.',
      'Determine an appropriate P/B multiple based on ROE and quality factors.',
      'Apply the multiple to BVPS to derive a target price.',
      'Compare to current price to assess valuation.',
    ],
    example: 'A bank has BVPS of $50 and ROE of 12%, above the peer average of 10%. Peers with similar ROE trade at 1.3x book. Target price = 1.3 × $50 = $65. If the stock trades at $55, it may be undervalued.',
    strengths: [
      'Directly applicable to bank business model.',
      'Easy to calculate and compare across banks.',
      'Book value provides tangible asset support.',
      'Well-established methodology with extensive research.',
    ],
    limitations: [
      'Book value may not reflect economic value.',
      'Accounting differences affect comparability.',
      'Does not directly value earnings or growth.',
      'Appropriate multiple is subjective and varies with conditions.',
    ],
    bankSpecific: 'For banks, P/B valuation is particularly relevant because equity capital is the foundation of their business. Regulators require minimum capital ratios, and excess capital can be returned to shareholders. The relationship between P/B and ROE is especially important - banks generating high returns on equity typically deserve higher P/B multiples.',

    type: 'Relative Valuation Method',
    shortDescription: 'Valuing banks based on the ratio of market price to per-share earnings.',
    description: 'Price to Earnings (P/E) valuation compares a bank\'s stock price to its earnings per share. While P/B is the primary valuation method for banks, P/E provides complementary insights about how the market values the bank\'s earning power. P/E is particularly useful for comparing banks with different capital structures.',
    formula: 'Target Price = Target P/E Multiple × Earnings Per Share',
    formulaExplanation: 'The target P/E multiple is determined based on earnings growth expectations, risk, and peer comparisons.',
    steps: [
      'Calculate the trailing twelve month or forward Earnings Per Share.',
      'Assess earnings quality and growth prospects.',
      'Determine an appropriate P/E multiple based on peer analysis.',
      'Apply the multiple to EPS to derive a target price.',
      'Compare to current price and other valuation methods.',
    ],
    example: 'A bank has EPS of $5.00 and consistent earnings growth. Peers trade at 10-12x earnings. Using 11x for average quality: Target price = 11 × $5.00 = $55.',
    strengths: [
      'Intuitive and widely used across industries.',
      'Directly values earnings power.',
      'Accounts for profitability differences.',
      'Forward P/E incorporates growth expectations.',
    ],
    limitations: [
      'Cyclical earnings can distort ratios.',
      'Negative earnings make P/E undefined.',
      'One-time items affect comparability.',
      'Does not account for capital intensity differences.',
    ],
    bankSpecific: 'Bank earnings are notably cyclical, swinging with credit cycles and interest rate changes. This cyclicality makes normalized earnings important for P/E analysis. Additionally, reserve releases or builds can significantly impact reported earnings without reflecting sustainable earning power.',

    name: 'ROE-P/B Valuation Framework',
    type: 'Fundamental Valuation Method',
    shortDescription: 'A framework linking justified price-to-book multiple to return on equity.',
    description: 'The ROE-P/B framework establishes a theoretical relationship between a bank\'s profitability (ROE) and its appropriate valuation multiple (P/B). The core insight is that banks generating returns above their cost of equity should trade above book value, while those earning below cost of equity should trade below. This framework helps identify mispriced banks.',
    formula: 'Justified P/B = (ROE - g) / (CoE - g)',
    formulaExplanation: 'ROE is Return on Equity, g is sustainable growth rate, and CoE is Cost of Equity. When ROE equals CoE, justified P/B equals 1.0x.',
    steps: [
      'Calculate the bank\'s sustainable Return on Equity.',
      'Estimate the bank\'s cost of equity (typically 8-12% for banks).',
      'Estimate sustainable growth rate (retention ratio × ROE).',
      'Calculate the justified P/B multiple.',
      'Compare to actual P/B to identify mis-valuation.',
    ],
    example: 'A bank has ROE of 14%, cost of equity of 10%, and growth of 3%. Justified P/B = (14% - 3%) / (10% - 3%) = 11% / 7% = 1.57x. If trading at 1.2x book, it may be undervalued.',
    strengths: [
      'Provides theoretical foundation for P/B multiples.',
      'Links valuation to fundamental profitability.',
      'Helps identify banks trading away from fair value.',
      'Accounts for cost of capital differences.',

    limitations: [
      'Requires estimates of cost of equity and growth.',
      'Assumes ROE is sustainable and stable.',
      'Sensitive to input assumptions.',
      'Does not capture all factors affecting bank value.',
    ],
    bankSpecific: 'This framework is particularly valuable for banks because the relationship between ROE and P/B is strong in the banking sector. Banks consistently earning ROE above 12-15% typically trade at premium P/B multiples, while those below 8% often trade at discounts. Analyzing where a bank falls on this spectrum helps identify valuation anomalies.',

    name: 'Dividend Discount Model',
    type: 'Intrinsic Value Method',
    shortDescription: 'Values a bank based on the present value of expected future dividends.',
    description: 'The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) values a stock as the present value of all expected future dividend payments. For banks, which typically pay regular dividends and face regulatory constraints on capital deployment, DDM can be a relevant valuation approach. The model assumes dividends grow at a sustainable rate indefinitely.',
    formula: 'Value = D₁ / (r - g)',
    formulaExplanation: 'D₁ is next year\'s expected dividend, r is the required return (cost of equity), and g is the perpetual dividend growth rate. This is the Gordon Growth Model, the simplest form of DDM.',

      'Determine the current annual dividend per share.',
      'Estimate sustainable dividend growth rate (ROE × retention ratio, or historical trend).',
      'Determine appropriate discount rate (cost of equity).',
      'Calculate intrinsic value using the formula.',
      'Compare to current price to assess valuation.',

    example: 'A bank pays $2.00 dividend, expected to grow at 4% annually. With 10% cost of equity: Value = $2.00 × 1.04 / (0.10 - 0.04) = $2.08 / 0.06 = $34.67.',

      'Does not value retained earnings directly.',
    ],
    bankSpecific: 'Bank dividends are subject to regulatory approval and stress testing. Capital requirements limit how much banks can pay out, making dividend growth more predictable but also constrained. When using DDM for banks, investors should consider regulatory capital plans and the likelihood of dividend increases or cuts.',

    shortDescription: 'Valuing a bank by comparing its metrics and multiples to similar banks.',
    description: 'Peer comparison analysis values a bank by examining how similar banks are valued in the market. By comparing key metrics (ROE, efficiency ratio, growth) and valuation multiples (P/B, P/E), investors can identify whether a bank trades at a premium or discount to peers and whether that premium or discount is justified.',
    formula: 'Implied Value = Peer Average Multiple × Subject Bank Metric',
