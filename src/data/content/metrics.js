    shortDescription: 'Measures how effectively a bank generates profits from shareholder investments.',
    description: 'Return on Equity (ROE) is one of the most important profitability metrics for evaluating banks. It measures how much profit a bank generates for every dollar of shareholder equity. A higher ROE indicates that the bank is using its equity capital more efficiently to generate earnings.',
    formulaExplanation: 'Net Income is the trailing twelve month (TTM) profit after all expenses and taxes. Average Shareholders\' Equity is calculated using a 5-point average of quarterly balance sheet values, following FFIEC methodology.',
    interpretation: 'ROE shows how well a bank is converting shareholder capital into profits. Banks with consistently high ROE are generally better at deploying capital and generating returns for shareholders. However, very high ROE can sometimes indicate excessive leverage or risk-taking.',

    shortDescription: 'Measures how efficiently a bank uses its total assets to generate earnings.',
    description: 'Return on Average Assets (ROAA) indicates how profitable a bank is relative to its total assets. Unlike ROE, ROAA is not affected by the bank\'s capital structure, making it useful for comparing banks with different leverage levels. It shows management\'s ability to generate earnings from the bank\'s asset base.',
    formulaExplanation: 'Net Income is the trailing twelve month profit. Average Total Assets is calculated using a 5-point average of quarterly balance sheet values.',
    interpretation: 'ROAA reveals how effectively bank management converts assets into profits. Since banks are asset-intensive businesses, even small improvements in ROAA can significantly impact overall profitability. ROAA is particularly useful for comparing banks of different sizes.',

    formulaExplanation: 'Net Interest Income equals Interest Income minus Interest Expense. Average Earning Assets includes loans, securities, and other interest-bearing assets.',
    interpretation: 'NIM reflects the bank\'s ability to earn a spread on its lending activities. Higher NIM indicates better pricing power or a favorable asset-liability mix. NIM is heavily influenced by interest rate environment and competitive conditions.',

    description: 'The Efficiency Ratio shows how much a bank spends to generate each dollar of revenue. It is calculated by dividing operating expenses by total revenue (net interest income plus non-interest income). A lower efficiency ratio indicates better cost management.',
    formulaExplanation: 'Non-Interest Expense includes salaries, occupancy costs, technology, and other operating expenses. The denominator represents total operating revenue.',
    interpretation: 'This ratio is a key indicator of operational efficiency. Banks with lower efficiency ratios are better at controlling costs relative to their revenue. Improving efficiency is a common strategic priority for banks seeking to enhance profitability.',

    formulaExplanation: 'Total Deposits includes all customer deposit accounts (checking, savings, CDs). Total Assets is the sum of all bank assets.',
    interpretation: 'Banks with higher deposit-to-asset ratios typically have more stable and lower-cost funding. Deposits are generally considered "sticky" funding that provides stability. Lower ratios may indicate reliance on more volatile wholesale funding.',

    description: 'The Equity to Assets ratio measures a bank\'s capital cushion relative to its asset base. It indicates the proportion of assets funded by shareholders rather than creditors. Higher ratios suggest greater financial strength and ability to absorb losses.',
    formulaExplanation: 'Total Shareholders\' Equity includes common and preferred stock plus retained earnings. Total Assets is the sum of all assets.',
    interpretation: 'This ratio reflects the bank\'s financial leverage and capital adequacy. Higher ratios indicate more conservative capital positions and greater capacity to absorb unexpected losses. However, very high ratios may indicate inefficient capital deployment.',
